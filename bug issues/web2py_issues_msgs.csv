1791,current object apparently empty when instantiate validator in a module file,2017-10-23T18:34:06Z,,,,,"Hello, Im having a problem with the validators translation..

 I set requires to a SQLFORM in a module file and then process the form

On validators.py have_current is True but is empty.

```
try:

    have_current = True
except ImportError:
    have_current = False

When function translate(text) call hasattr(current, 'T') return False
```
def translate(text):
    if text is None:

Only work with validators instantiated in models.

Is a bug or I am missing something??

1790,Invoking sql queries from threads results in error,2017-10-20T09:48:10Z,,,`AttributeError,"`AttributeError: 'thread._local' object has no attribute '_pydal_connection_139988697348176_13906'`","I've switched to newer version (2.15.4-stable) and found out that my code for retrieving data from database does not work anymore. It crashes on invoking 'executesql' from thread with error:
`AttributeError: 'thread._local' object has no attribute '_pydal_connection_139988697348176_13906'`

Invoking queries from main thread works correctly, this happens only calling it from threads.
Sample code:
```import threading
from gluon import current

class runSQL(threading.Thread):
	def __init__(self, sql, db_node):
		super(runSQL, self).__init__()
		self.sql = sql
		self.db_node = db_node

	def run(self):
		print ""THREAD RESULT:"", self.db_node.executesql(self.sql)
		
def test():
	db_nodes = current.data_nodes
	sql = ""SELECT 1""
	
	threads = []
	for db in db_nodes:
		print ""MAIN RESULT:"", db.executesql(sql)
		
		new_thread = runSQL(sql, db)
		threads.append(new_thread)
		new_thread.start()
		
	for t in threads:
		t.join()
```
Where data_nodes are DAL objects connecting to postgres database.

That same code worked correctly on version 2.14.6-stable. Am i doing something wrong, is there a new way to run sql queries in threads? Or can anyone confirm this as a bug?
Thanks.

The code above causes multiple workers to set themselves as tickers under the following circumstances:

1. The function ""being_a_ticker()"" successfully executes itself until the point updating the worker as the ticker (is_ticker=True)
2. Then when it wants to set all other workers as is_ticker=False it fails half way.
3. The exception is correctly captured, error prints out correctly but in line 1236 the half successfull code is commited... so there is more than one ticker on the database.
4. Scheduler stops working.

Fix:
Adding a simple raise after printing the message should be enough to fix it:
```
         try: 
             self.is_a_ticker = self.being_a_ticker()

The `represented` method of the base `ExportClass` class extracts the tablename and fieldname to get the `Field` object from the table definition, so it ended up doing `db['""tablename""']['""fieldname""']`, which generated an error. The `ExportTSV` class is the only exporter that uses the `represented` method, so it was the only one affected."

Since the field already have an image and I just want to update others fields it does not make sense to fire this error. Debugging a bit I found that upload field value (from input) is sent empty (b'') and the is_empty() function (called from IS_EMPTY_OR()) is returning ""NOT EMPTY"" cause only value '' and [] are treated as empty (not b''). It worked fine when I changed the bold line in is_empty() function to:

<pre>
def is_empty(value, empty_regex=None):
    _value = value
    """"""test empty field""""""

Every time I change the code in a .py file that is located in the modules, the changes are never reflected unless I kill web2py process (stop/start web2py server does not solve the issue).

I'm a newcomer to web2py so I was assuming that this should not occur. It seems that the server will always use the .pyc files and ignore the changes to .py. Is there a way while in development stage to change this behavior? The imported modules should have the same behavior as the controllers when editing in the web2py user interface.

Poc:
. Create _\_\_init_\_\_.py inside the /applications/app/modules/ folder
. Create mytest.py inside the /applications/app/modules/ folder with a function with a print string
. Inside one of the controllers import the module as 

> from mytest import function

. Call the function inside one of the methods of the controller
. Confirm the output in the console
. Change the output string of the function and confirm that it does not reflect the change next time the function is called.

1733,github export problem,2017-08-12T21:02:17Z,,,,,"From: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/TGKkRINprG0

Since updating from 2.14.6 to 2.15.2 (and also 2.15.3 released just moments ago) I have some problems with the default ExportClasses in SQLFORM.grid.
I am using MSSQL as database.
The grid displays just fine, only the export faild (to tsv and, in some cases, to csv - I did not test others).

I'll spare you the complete traceback and get directly to what I could find by implementing my own ExportClass.

At first I got a <type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>, the relevant traceback was:
File ""C:\Users\riek\PycharmProjects\web2py\gluon\sqlhtml.py"", line 3563, in represented
    row.append(record._extra[col])
I didn't use any type _extra fields, meaning that the regex check in line 3562 failed (self.rows.db._adapter.REGEX_TABLE_DOT_FIELD.match(col)).

I then overwrote the ""represented""-Function with my own, ignoring this check and forcing the else-branch. 

This lead to the following exception: <type 'exceptions.AttributeError'> 'DAL' object has no attribute '""t_schule""'. So my tables and fields are quoted and thus not found.

I tried a solution I found somewhere else, setting entity_quoting=False in my DAL-instance, didn't change anything.

I then searched some more and found this bugfix: https://github.com/web2py/web2py/issues/1542
It appears that this fix quotes the tables and fields, no matter if entity_quoting is enabled or not.

I could solve my particular problem with an ugly hack, by removing the quotes in the represent-function of my ExportClass (line 3565 in sqlhtml.py: (t, f) = col.replace('""','').split('.')  instead of (t, f) = col.split('.')) 
I am wondering though if this is a bug or I am not properly understanding how the quoting works."

When web2py SAML SP os CAS client is configured as alternate login the system auto create the users once he is logged into the SAML IDP or CAS server. Now with auth.settings.cas_create_user you can specify if the user is autocreated or you need to created first.

Another improvement is to have a custom change password url for external methods. For example, when the user configure the CAS client or SAML SP and click in change password. If change_password_url is configured. The SP will redirect to change_password_url. Good if the you want to configure the IDP change password page.

1702,Fix autocomplete called after user_signature chk,2017-07-28T01:22:14Z,2017-08-01T14:46:01Z,,,,"Fixes #1699 which was caused by the autocomplete widget only being called after a user_signature check and the signature not being there.  

The default values for user_signature and hash_vars make this work with the grid when it has the user_signature=True option without any problem when that isn't the case. Users can disable it if they want or change it according to what they're verifying in their controllers.   
  
The autocomplete widget will still fail with the default kwargs in a situation where it is called in a controller function that first verifies the URL signature with hash_vars=True.  
  
For users having that problem, there's no way around this without inserting a security flaw, so they must sadly change their application code to give the autocomplete widget the needed user_signature and hash_vars argument."

                plural='Organizzazioni'
                )
```
The code portion which raises that error is:

```python
clienti = [
            (I(_class=""fa fa-bank"") + SPAN(org.name), False, 
                URL('organizzazione', 'set_curr_org', args=[org.id])) for org in db(db.organization.name == False).select()
          ]
```

I printed out what the SELECT statement would look like and this is the result:

```sql
SELECT ""organization"".""id"", ""organization"".""name"", ""organization"".""ragione_sociale"", ""organization"".""partita_iva"", ""organization"".""indirizzo"", ""organization"".""localita"", ""organization"".""telefono"", ""organization"".""fax"", ""organization"".""emailAttivita"", ""organization"".""sistema"", ""organization"".""cliente"", ""organization"".""fornitore"" FROM ""organization"" WHERE (""organization"".""name"" = 'False');
```

This is the same select(), but in web2py 2.14.6:

```sql
SELECT  organization.id, organization.name, organization.ragione_sociale, organization.partita_iva, organization.indirizzo, organization.localita, organization.telefono, organization.fax, organization.emailAttivita, organization.sistema, organization.cliente, organization.fornitore FROM organization WHERE (organization.name = 'False');
```

Please note the new presence of the quotation marks that force postgres to look for **organization.emailAttivita** column, which it has been created instead as **organization.emailattivita** by the original migration:

```
                                     Table ""public.organization""
     Column      |          Type          |                         Modifiers                         
-----------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------
 id              | integer                | not null default nextval('organization_id_seq'::regclass)
 name            | character varying(512) | 
 emailattivita   | text[]                 | 
 sistema         | character(1)           | 
 fax             | character varying(512) | 
 indirizzo       | character varying(512) | 
 ragione_sociale | character varying(512) | 
 partita_iva     | character varying(512) | 
 telefono        | character varying(512) | 
 localita        | character varying(512) | 
 fornitore       | character(1)           | 
 cliente         | character(1)           | 
```

**A workaround exists**: setting the `rname` value as 'emailattivita' in the field constructor leads to this SELECT (which works):

```sql
SELECT ""organization"".""id"", ""organization"".""name"", ""organization"".""ragione_sociale"", ""organization"".""partita_iva"", ""organization"".""indirizzo"", ""organization"".""localita"", ""organization"".""telefono"", ""organization"".""fax"", ""organization"".emailattivita, ""organization"".""sistema"", ""organization"".""cliente"", ""organization"".""fornitore"" FROM ""organization"" WHERE (""organization"".""name"" = 'False');
```

Does this issue depend on an adapter (or psycopg) update?"
1696,websocket_messaging in Python 3,2017-07-25T20:51:36Z,2017-08-07T12:27:36Z,,,,"I ran into 3 problems when trying to get WebSockets working on Py3:

1.  `import gluon.utils` failed.
2. Strings were sometimes bytecode, causing mismatches of groups.
3. function `to_native` was unavailable.

For 1) All I had to was to copy the file to web2py root and run from there. Maybe a documentation change would be sufficient?

For 2) I changed line 144 and 145 in the PostHandler post function from:

```
message = self.request.arguments['message'][0]
group = self.request.arguments.get('group', ['default'])[0]
```

to:

```
message = self.request.arguments['message'][0].decode(encoding='UTF-8')
group = self.request.arguments.get('group', ['default'])[0].decode(encoding='UTF-8')
```
The log message on hello world example went from  `MESSAGE to b'mygroup':b'Hello World'` to `MESSAGE to mygroup:Hello World`.

For 3) only an additional import was required: `from gluon._compat import to_native`. Then things ran smoothly.

1695,Custom fieldstyle function silently failing,2017-07-25T00:36:35Z,,,,,"In order to guarantee backwards compatibility, the `SQLFORM.createform` function is wrapping the `formstyle()` call (which might be user-defined) waiting for a `TypeError` exception:

```
            # sqlhtml.py:1411
            try:
                table = formstyle(self, xfields)
                for id, a, b, c in xfields:
                    self.field_parent[id] = getattr(b, 'parent', None) \
                        if isinstance(b, XmlComponent) else None
            except TypeError:
                # backward compatibility, 4 argument function is the old style

                    newrows = formstyle(id, a, b, c)

That means that if anything inside the function raises `TypeError` you'll get a confusing traceback. For example, if I have:

```
def my_formstyle(form, fields):

And `request.args(0) is None`, then a ticket will be generated with:

Got a reply on the user group from Anthony stating that support was lost during some move to pydal contrib lib.  Suggested opening a ticket.  Should it be here or for pydal?

1687,a bug of translation breaks the menu hyperlink of a new simple application.,2017-07-15T16:44:47Z,2017-07-18T08:44:20Z,,,,"Python 3.6, web2py 2.15.1, chrome.
For testing the new version of web2py 2.15.1, I create a new simple application through the administrative interface. I find a very strange bug. When the application name length is shorter than 4 (for example 'soma') and  the T.accepted_language is zh-cn,the index.html of the application looks like the following 
![20170716001839](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25625873/28240997-44274a02-69be-11e7-9d32-8ee4927f8af9.png)

the caret symbol disappear and there is no child element of the hyberlink as unusual . After some debugging, I guess the language translation result in this bug when the request language is zh-cn. I am not familiar with gluon/languages.py and gluon/compileapp.py. 

You can recurrent the bug under web2py 2.15.1 with the following steps:
1. create a new simple application whose name is 'soma' or any other string whose length is shorter than 4.
2. add one line code to the index function of the default controller
```
def index():
    T.force('zh-cn') ## add this line to force your T.accepted_language to zh-cn
    response.flash = T(""Hello World"") 
    return dict(message=T('Welcome to web2py!'))

Could anyone help to fix this bug.

However, per the [docs for the function](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blame/master/gluon/validators.py#L2750), ""If a salt is specified use it, if salt is True, set salt to uuid (this should all be backward compatible)."" This change means a specified `salt` will **never** be used. 

**The fix**: revert this change, leaving the line as `if self.crypt.salt == True:`, with perhaps a comment on the necessity of this syntax.

**Notes**: Based on [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-annotations) (see the recommendation just above this anchor), there is no way to write this nicely.

The wizard should never have let me create a table beginning with `auth_`. If it had prevented this, then I would not have experienced the misleading, inaccurate error that I did.

The error message is inaccurate. It claims that the auth_* tables are already created. But upon inspecting my database tables, I do not see any such tables created. The error message is misleading because the real issue is using `auth_` to prefix my personal table names."

I think, it should be the following code (I have found it in another version on markmin2html.py

```python
s = '<blockquote%s%s>%s</blockquote>%s' \

I am working on it at a slow pace... I get it to work, but for some reason it only kick it the second time to focus the field, I guess there is some class that didn't get set properly as I only replace Calendar.set() by flatpickr jquery syntax... I have been able to init flatpickr for time type field as asked by Anthony with faltpickr API.

It remains to figure how we are going to handle the localization as for ISO format for date and 24hrs for time. Not sure what the web2py Calendar date default format, but flatpickr use ISO. Calendar was set with 24hrs format for time with datetime type field. We may want to allow this to be configure without having to go in web2py.js???

After investigation it appears that queue_task is writing dictionary values into oracle DB as string represented JSON in order to save this value as VARCHAR2(512) into the vars and args columns of database  table scheduler_task.

As a work around I have had to put the below trigger on the Oracle database in order to remove the single quotes from the values before insert into the db for any of my tasks to complete. 

create or replace trigger replace_quotes
before insert on SCHEDULER_TASK

1634,"REST - IP address as parameter, web2py thinks the last octet is an extension",2017-05-18T13:27:12Z,2017-06-14T14:30:54Z,,,,"Hi, 

I am currently building a rather simple REST-interface based on Web2py (Version 2.14.6-stable+timestamp.2016.05.10.00.21.47) and found a bug. 

I want to provide an interface which queries our IPAM-solution for infos about a specified IP address/network, e.g.
1- https://web2pyhost/rest/net/192.168.1.1
2- https://web2pyhost/rest/net/192.168.1.0/24
3- https://web2pyhost/rest/net/192.168.1.1.

This is my controller:
```python
@request.restful()
def net():
    response.view = 'generic.json'

    def GET(ip, mask=0):
        if IS_IPV4()(ip)[1]:
            return dict(result=dict(error=""Invalid ip address""))
        if IS_INT_IN_RANGE(0, 33)(mask)[1]:
            return dict(result=dict(error=""Invalid mask""))
        if mask != 0:
            return dict(result=getRESTInfoForNetwork(""%s/%s""%(ip,mask)))
        else:
            return dict(result=getRESTInfoForIP(ip))
    return locals()
```
The first URL does not work, but the second does. It seems like the parameter ip only contains the first three octets. A simple workaround is to append another ""."" and it works (URL 3). 

Everything after the last ""."" (if there is any) is considered an extension and therefore does not work for an ip address (line 371+372):

**web2py/gluon/globals.py:**
```python
 364     def restful(self):
 365         def wrapper(action, request=self):

 378                     raise HTTP(405, ""method not allowed"")
 379                 try:
 380                     res = rest_action(*request.args, **request.vars)
 381                     if is_json and not isinstance(res, str):
 382                         res = json(res)
 383                     return res
 384                 except TypeError, e:
 385                     exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()
 386                     if len(traceback.extract_tb(exc_traceback)) == 1:
 387                         raise HTTP(400, ""invalid arguments"")
 388                     else:
 389                         raise
 390             f.__doc__ = action.__doc__
 391             f.__name__ = action.__name__
 392             return f
 393         return wrapper
```

This may be a very special and I can live with my workaround. It is up to you, if you want to handle arguments with an ""."" that's not meant as a separator between filename and extension. A simple solution would be to check if there is more than one ""."", if it is just one, than it is probably an extension, if more than one, it might not be an extension.

best regards, 
Peter

When I inspect the 'contratos' variable value using the pycharm debugger I have noted that it returns a Row object for the 'auth_group' table and the 'role' column of that table.

Going further on my debugging I have noticed that in the adapters/base.py the table name changes from contratos to auth_group. I don't understand very well the code inside that file but it seems that there is a bug somewhere.

This is my first question for the list; up to now i have been lurking and learning mainly. 
I think it is fair to say I am not an experienced python programmer so - this might just be my lack of knowledge. Forgive me please if my question shows just that.

I built a form that enables users to choose more than 1 row through a checkbox.
This form and the subsequent handling just works fine, as long as I choose more than 1 row.

If you want to take a look at  the piece of code from the view below  - the value for the box is the ID of the table-record:

---
         {{for lijst in lijsten:}}
            <tr>
                <td>{{=lijst.methode.titel}}</td>
                <td>{{=lijst.woordenlijst.titel}}</td>
                <td style=""width:100px"">{{=lijst.woordenlijst.taal_links}}</td>
                <td style=""width:100px"">{{=lijst.woordenlijst.taal_rechts}}</td>
                <td><input type=""checkbox"" name=""keuzelijst"" value=""{{=lijst.woordenlijst.id}}""/></td> !!!!! 
            </tr>
        {{pass}}
---

If I however choose just one row that has an ID say 38 --> then the following happens when dealing with the choices:

---
   if request.vars:
        for x in range(len(request.vars.keuzelijst)):
            db.lijst_ovh.insert(gebruiker=auth.user_id,wlijst=request.vars.keuzelijst[x],overhoring=currentOvh)
---
First of all: the length of request.vars.keuzelijst appears to be 2 ??
The ID (38) is being split into 2 separate values: first loop  3 and the next loop 8

So what am I doing wrong here?

I hope you can help me with this 

Regards

1588,Virtual Fields do not appear to work with Autocomplete widget,2017-03-09T17:18:56Z,2017-06-20T20:05:52Z,,,,"I've seen a few posts in the mailing list where people could not figure out how to get a Virtual Field to work in the Autocomplete widget. Most just say it isn't supported. One post noted that `db=db(db.table)` should be included into the Autocomplete widget. That certainly helps, but I see an error.

```
Set object has no attribute __getitem__
```

This is because `db(db.table)` is a Set object, and the following code won't work with a Set object:
https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/9978e63621d8f14e5d93ae5feb767b200a77e797/gluon/sqlhtml.py#L693-L697

Notice that the Autocomplete widget actively looks for `Field.Virtual`, so it seems like it is supported.

What I don't understand is line 697: `field.tablename`. Clearly, `field` is a `Virtual.Field` based on line 695, and the virtual field class seems to always have `tablename` set to `None` (at least in the most recent release R-2.14.6). Regardless of my `Set` error above, I'm not sure I understand why this chunk of code is written this way.

I must be missing something about virtual fields to make them work with Autocomplete, but I have not been able to find anything in the mailing list or Github issues. A dive into the code only raises more questions, like why bother with `field.tablename` if it is guaranteed to be `None`?"

1579,test_expose_base_inside_dir2_state fails on OSX pointing to tools.Expose() failing in similar cases,2017-02-26T23:26:58Z,2017-06-20T19:30:02Z,,AssertionError,"AssertionError: Lists differ: [] != ['link_to_dir1']","checked in trunk: commit16f60d5 (30 jan 2017)

## Problem
The test below checks the class Expose in gluon/tools by creating a folder structure in  /var/folders, but it fails in macos. I think I know why but I'm not sure about the fix.

## What's happening
As a security measure issue (#1261) the files found in the exposed folder passed to Expose() are checked by calling isprivate() (and by calling issymlink() to prevent linking to 'outside' the folder)

**from class Expose in gluon.tools.py**
>6274 self.base = self.normalize_path(
>6275                     base or os.path.join(current.request.folder, 'static'))
>...
>6277: self.base = base = os.path.realpath(base or os.path.join(current.request.folder, 'static'))
>...
>6296: allowed = [f for f in sorted(glob.glob(path))
>6297:                   if not any([self.isprivate(f), self.issymlink_out(f)])]
>... 
>6355: def isprivate(f):
>6355        return 'private' in f or f.startswith('.') or f.endswith('~')

The filenames are based on the parameter 'base' which are first conditionaly converted by self.normalize_path() and then again unconditionaly (why two times?) by os.path.realpath(). os.path.realpath() follows the symlinks this results at least on OS X El Capitan in a problem. 

*/var/folders* is really */private/var/folders* . This causes isprivate() to return True allways and as a consequence *self.folders* isn't updated and neither is *self.filenames* in line 6298-6301. This causes the test below to fail and of course Expose() to fail when it is pointing to /var or other folders in /private, again possibly limited to OS X. 

Note that in stable 2.14 realpath() is not used. It was added in trunk for good security reasons in https://github.com/web2py/web2py/pull/1357 

## Possible fix:
Change class  Expose() to allow starting with '/private' in function isprivate() or better remove '/private' from the filename if present before the test? 

Little hacky maybe and not in line with the current documentation which promises hiding on the occurrence of the string *private* see http://www.web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/14/other-recipes?search=Publishing%20a%20folder
Better ideas?

The problem is that these validators then return the stripped version of the value instead of the original value. This means that values that are not just whitespace but include some whitespace will be transformed before being inserted in the database. For example, "" hello "" will be transformed to ""hello"". This behavior is unexpected, as the purpose of these validators is not to remove whitespace from otherwise non-empty strings.

It may be appropriate to strip whitespace in order to determine whether a string should be considered empty (and we probably have to continue that to maintain backward compatibility), but I think returned the stripped value instead of the original value should be considered a bug. If the developer wants to strip whitespace from submitted values, that should be handled explicitly via another validator or some other method.

1566,"Add FlexibleService, which allows @service-style methods with varargs",2017-01-28T22:12:29Z,2017-03-21T17:18:10Z,,,,"This addresses #1561 .

I don't know what your testing procedure is for things like this.  I see that the current test_tools.py just has TestService as ""todo"" so this would be in line with that.  I've done some simple tests by creating a sample app and calling the service endpoints and it works.  In any case, this change only adds a new class, so it shouldn't affect any existing behavior.

The PR defines a new FlexibleService class that inherits from the existing Service.  It overrides that various `serve_whatever` methods so that instead of using `universal_caller`, they use a method `call_service_function` provided by FlexibleService.  The default implementation of this method just directly calls the function, passing whatever arguments were given to the ""call"" controller function.  This means the service function can accept `*args` and/or `**kwargs`.  This also means that if the service function doesn't accept the passed arguments, an exception will be raised, rather than returning an ""Object does not exist"" 404 as Service currently does.  Using a method for `call_service_function` instead of a module-level function means that it's possible to write new classes that inherit from FlexibleService and add more sophisticated argument checking if they want to.

The new FlexibleService class also addresses bug #1560 by fixing the errors in the CSV and XML methods so that they store and find the procedures in the right place.  This does not, however, fix the bug in Service itself that stores these procedures in the wrong place."

**If you try to remove it (clicking on ""delete"" button in the SQLFORM.grid) it shows ""not authorized"" popup (sometimes no popup at all(?)).**

1562,don't write to /dev/urandom on Windows platforms,2017-01-22T20:16:01Z,2017-01-30T18:47:51Z,,,,"Fixes a bug on Windows which only shows up when the following requirement is met: There is a folder named ""dev"" which is a base folder on the same drive where web2py is. In this special case a file named ""urandom"" is written into the ""dev"" folder. Clearly this was never meant to happen, as it doesn't serve the intended purpose."
1561,"Provide a way to write ""service"" functions that accept *args/**kwargs",2017-01-21T04:31:54Z,2017-05-11T06:24:52Z,,,,"Currently, if you write a ""service"" function using the decorators like `@service.json`, etc., it can't usefull accept varargs.  This is because the `universal_caller` function in gluon.tools only passes arguments that explicitly correspond to named arguments in the service function's signature.  (This in turn is likely because `universal_caller` is working based on things like `co_argcount`, which doesn't provide a way to see whether a function accepts varargs.)  See mailing list discussion [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/Xlrobpwv5Aw).

It would be nice to be able to write a service function that accepts arbitrary `*args` and/or `**kwargs`, passed as part of the URL path or as URL parameters, respectively.

Since `universal_caller` is a standalone function, this would probably require creating a new analogue of the Service class that rewrites the various `serve_*` methods to use a different function instead.  (Modifying `Service` directly could change the behavior of existing code.)  The simplest alternative is just:

```
def new_universal_caller(f, *a, **b):
    f(*a, **b)
```

This is basically what `request.restful` does.

If we do want to maintain the convention of passing only accepted arguments, we could use something like this:

```
def new_universal_caller(f, *a, **b):  
    argspec = inspect.getargspec(f)

    requiredArgs = argspec.args if argspec.defaults is None else argspec.args[0:-len(argspec.defaults)] 

    # if it accepts *args, we pass all positional arguments, otherwise only the number it accepts
    args = a if argspec.varargs is not None else a[:len(argspec.args)]
    
    # if it accepts **kwargs, we pass all keyword arguments, otherwise only those it accepts
    kwargs = b if argspec.keywords is not None else {argName: b[argName] for argName in argspec.args if argName in b}
       
    # it's an error to pass an argument both positionally and by keyword
    if any(argName in argspec.args[:len(args)] for argName in kwargs):
        raise HTTP(404, ""Argument passed positionally and by keyword"")
    # if we didn't get enough positional arguments, any missing ones must have been passed by keyword
    if any(argName not in kwargs for argName in requiredArgs[len(args):]):
        raise HTTP(404, ""Not enough arguments passed"")
    # otherwise, ok
    else:
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
```

`inspect.getargspec` provides a way to tell if the function accepts varargs or not.

One question is: is there a reason that the existing `Service` class doesn't just pass all arguments to the service function?  Or would it be better to just pass them all, as `request.restful` does, and accept that an exception will be raised if the arguments aren't right?"
1560,Some Service types lumped together incorrectly,2017-01-18T23:05:24Z,2017-05-11T06:24:45Z,,,,"In gluon.tools, the Service class defines a number of attributes run_procedures, json_procedures, etc., for storing different types of service functions.  However, some of the decorator methods store the decorated functions in an incorrect place.  For instance:

```
    def csv(self, f):
        """"""
        Example:
            Use as::

                service = Service()
                @service.csv
                def myfunction(a, b):
                    return a + b
                def call():
                    return service()

            Then call it with::

                wget http://..../app/default/call/csv/myfunction?a=3&b=4

        """"""
        self.run_procedures[f.__name__] = f
        return f
```

You can see at the end it is putting it in `run_procedures`, but this is the `csv` decorator, so it should be putting it in `csv_procedures`.  The `xml` decorator likewise stores the function it gets under `run_procedures` rather than `xml_procedures`.  In fact, the `csv_procedures` and `xml_procedures` attributes are never used at all.

More worrisome, both `serve_csv` and `serve_xml` actually look in `run_procedures` rather than `csv_procedures` or `xml_procedures` to see if the passed service is valid.  This means that if you define a function with `@service.csv`, you will be able to access it with a URL like `.../call/run/my_function`, and vice versa.  Effectively there is no distinction between ""run"", CSV, and xml services.  This can potentially lead to strange errors; you can for instance define a `@service.run` function that doesn't return data in a CSV format, which will cause an error if you try to access it via `../call/csv` since the handler is unable to parse it as CSV.

Looking at git blame, it appears the error has been present for several years (maybe since Service was added?), but apparently hasn't been noticed."

1558,Fix router functions check,2017-01-13T21:11:17Z,2017-01-19T15:23:17Z,,,,"Consider the following router:

    routers=dict(
        BASE=dict(
            default_controller='default',
            default_function='index',
                functions=['index', 'func1', 'comp1']
        )
    )

Now include the following component in a view:

    {{=LOAD('default', 'comp1.load', ajax=True)}}

This component will make an Ajax request to `/comp1.load`. The router must then determine whether `""comp1.load""` is a URL arg for the `/default/index` function, or whether it is actually a function itself (to be routed to `/default/comp.load`). To make this determination, it simply checks whether `""comp.load""` is in the `router['BASE']['functions']` list. This check fails, so the request gets routed to `/default/index/comp.load` rather than the correct `/default/comp.load`.

Currently, the `functions` list in the router only works properly if it includes all permutations of functions and extensions that the app will use. In the above example, it would have to be:

                functions=['index', 'func1', 'comp1.load']

This pull request strips the extension before checking the functions list, so a request to ""comp.load"" would correctly match ""comp"" in the functions list.

Perhaps there is some rationale for the current behavior, but in that case, the rewrite code that maps outgoing URLs must be changed. Given the above example, `URL('default', 'comp1.load')` would generate `/comp1.load`, which will then be routed to `/default/index/comp1.load`. It should instead generate `/default/comp1.load` -- otherwise, there is no way to generate a URL for the `/default/comp1.load` route."
1557,Improvement on alternate login methods (CAS and SAML),2017-01-09T10:51:25Z,,,,,"These changes I have been testing and working correctly in my computer. If you approve I can merge the changes.

When web2py SAML SP os CAS client is configured as alternate login the system auto create the users once he is logged into the SAML IDP or CAS server. I suggest to have a extra value to customize if you want to have auto create users or if you want them to be created manually into your SAML SP or CAS client. It will be easy with a new variable: auth.settings.cas_create_user

```
def get_or_create_user(self, keys, update_fields=['email'],
                           login=True, get=True):
....

     elif checks:
            **if self.settings.cas_create_user is False:
                   raise HTTP(403, ""Forbidden. User need to be created first."")**

            if 'first_name' not in keys and 'first_name' in table_user.fields:
....

```

Another improvement is to have a custom change password url for external methods. For example, when the user configure the CAS client or SAML SP and click in change password could be great if the link redirects to the server. For example, to have the next code (option) into saml_auth.py and cas_auth.py:

```
def change_password_url(self, next=""/""):
        self._SAML_change_password()
        return next

def change_password_url(self, next=""/""):
        self._CAS_change_password()
        return next

After much digging, I traced the problem to this line in compileapp.py/run_controller_in():

The problem is that the shell controller creates its own environment to run the command in, modifying current.response.
Changing this line to:
`response = environment[""response""]`
Fixes the problem.  This is also arguably more clear since ""environment[""response""]._vars is undoubtably the intended target of the controller, a tls global is not required to access it.

A separate is arguably that env() (as called from shell.py/callback()) creates a new environment, ""current"" is clobbered, and not restored after calling gluon.contrib.shell.run()

1536,Update of float is not working ,2016-11-26T10:47:31Z,,,,,"When I try to update a float field dal is behaving very strange.
Instead of executing the float expression, it is converting the field to text and is trying to concatenate.
To overcome this problem I am doing double subctartion.
You can see this problem if you copy the following code into a controller:
```
def initTestTable():
    db.testTable.insert(testFloat=0.1)
    tuples=db(db.testTable.id>0).select(db.testTable.ALL)
    return locals()

def updateTestTable():
    db(db.testTable.id==1).update(testFloat=db.testTable.testFloat+1.0) # EITHER NOT WORKING AT ALL OR IS TRYING TO CONCATINATE
    print db._lastsql

    db(db.testTable.id==1).update(testFloat=db.testTable.testFloat-(-1.0)) # THIS IS WORKING
    print db._lastsql
    
    tuples=db(db.testTable.id>0).select(db.testTable.ALL)
    return locals()
```

and the following code into db.py:
`db.define_table('testTable', Field('testFloat', 'float',   default=0.0))
`

In the past I was using postgresql and I had not seen that problem.
Now I have migrated to the last mySql, the last web2py and to a new developing PC and I saw this problem."

The issue is that sometimes a web2py application is only one part of a larger project.  The current design of web2py forces the entire application to reside inside the web2py directory subtree.  The `folders=` config option can be used to move the `applications` directory outside the web2py dir, but each app still needs to be located inside that global apps directory.

What is needed is a way to specify an arbitrary directory for each app individually.  Each app should be able to stored anywhere in the file system, and there should be a way to tell web2py where to find it if it's not in the default apps directory.

Actually doing `obj.foo = None` just changes the value of `obj` to `None`, which is not deleting the item if you rely in `Storage.__contains__`. Instead, only `del obj.foo` really deletes the item.

```

[This line](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/1877f497309e71918aa78e1a1288cbe3cb5392ec/gluon/dal.py#L81):

```
 requires[0] = validators.IS_EMPTY_OR(requires[0], null='' if field in ('string', 'text', 'password') else None)
```

should instead be:

```
 requires[0] = validators.IS_EMPTY_OR(requires[0], null='' if field.type in ('string', 'text', 'password') else None)

Notice, `field.type` rather than `field`.

Very very important notes:
- pbkdf2_ctypes.py comes from our very own @michele-comitini : dunno why we lived on a slightly older release
- pbkdf2.py was refreshed from the latest version
- apps using directly gluon.contrib.aes will need to rewrite code (in case) to use pyaes
- @mdipierro : pyaes comes from https://github.com/ricmoo/pyaes . I included license and readme: feel free to drop those in favour of a license recap of all 3rd party
- nowhere in the readme or the book (I noticed just reading the code) mentions that a big speedup on web2py and secure cookies needs pycrypto (or the more versatile pycryptodome) installed...we should:
  - make a note on the book and remember to fetch the dep on the installation scripts for prod environment
  - cook next release binaries with pycrypto included

1485,response._view_environment missing in scheduler and shell,2016-10-03T16:29:25Z,2016-10-05T00:40:11Z,,,,"https://github.com/web2py/web2py/commit/b4acfd0724845633f667a55e593a15576379554d results in a failure to create `response._view_environment` when running scheduler tasks or the shell. Now, `response._view_environment` is only created in `gluon.main.serve_controller`, which only gets called for HTTP requests. A fix, is to create `response._view_environment` in `gluon.shell.env`, after the models have been run (just as in `gluon.main.serve_controller`).

```
    if import_models:
        try:
            run_models_in(environment)
        except RestrictedError as e:
            sys.stderr.write(e.traceback + '\n')
            sys.exit(1)

    response._view_environment = copy.copy(environment)  # <-- ADD THIS LINE
```

Note, this should actually be an improvement over the previous situation. In the original code, `response._view_environment` was set in `gluon.compileapp.build_environment`, which was run _before_ `run_models_in` -- so, the `_view_environment` did not includes objects created in the models. This change rectifies that problem.

However, while running scheduler tasks request.is_scheduler = None instead of True. The current None value seems strange/non-intuitive.

```

#To really know if you're running under the scheduler you must use this which makes no sense

The gain is ~15% running welcome default controller. @abastardi would you mind computing TechEmpower Benchmarks?

On the other hand since application files can change, such optimization requires a way to erase the cache (maintained in a dict in cfs.py). An idea is to erase such cache in `compile_application()`. What do you think?

What I've tried: `Field('updated_on', 'datetime', update=request.now, writable=False, readable=False),` (I have also tried adding `default=request.now` too).
What it currently does: When I create the record it fills with the current date, but when I modify it, it does not change and its value remains the same.

The web2py book says: **`update` contains the default value for this field when the record is updated.** Which pretty much describes what I'm trying to achieve.

1424,TAG / web2pyHTMLParser doubles <br/> self closing tag,2016-08-15T10:13:19Z,,,,,"ORIGINALLY:::

TAG() helper is interesting.  i'm running web2py version 2.14.6.  here is a controller function:

```
def viewTest():
    raw = '<html><head><title>ok man</title></head><body><p>this is a test <input type=""text""></input><br />of the American Broadcast System. <input type=""text""></input><br />this is only a test. <input type=""text""></input></p></body></html>'
    rawHead = raw[raw.find('<head>')+6:raw.rfind('</head>')]
    rawBody = raw[raw.find('<body>')+6:raw.rfind('</body>')]
    div = TAG(rawBody)
    ss = div.elements('input')
    return HTML(HEAD(TAG(rawHead)), BODY(CAT(P(""rawHead: "", rawHead, BR(), ""rawBody: "", rawBody), div, P(""%i"" % len(ss), ""%s"" % type(div)))))
```

the most interesting part, and i think it is a bug in TAG of web2py, is that it doubles the `<br />` with `<br></br><br></br>`.  and if you only make it `<br>`, without the slash, it will return the proper single `<br></br>` but then return two more `<br></br>` at the very end before the `</p>`, which totally throws off spacing if that is important.  AND finally, if you have `<br></br>`, instead of `<br />`, it doubles each by replacing it with `<br></br><br></br>`.

BUT THEN I ALSO REALIZED:::

so weird, TAG is changing `<br>` or `<br />` to `<br></br>`, which makes sense and isn't horrible.  but, firefox, IE, and safari translated that into two `<br></br>`, instead of only one.  so it really expands the carriage returns.  but i need it to conserve the br's into `<br>` or `<br/>` and not `<br></br>`.

it also seems that web2py processes the view in such a way as to conserve the br's without adding extra `</br>` end tags, but how do i render and web2pyHTMLParser without adding those extra `</br>` endings?

SO IN THE END:::
anthony on google groups said i should post this issue on github as a bug, and so i did.

`http://.../a/c/f?keywords=&order=mytable.myfield&_signature=...`

The problem is, changing `order=mytable.myfield` to `order=mytable.myfield1` (or any random string which doesn't satisfy the `table.field` structure) raises a KeyError. 

```

It would be better if that line could be wrapped inside a `try/except KeyError` and just ignore the `order` parameter. 

As a workaround, until this is fixed, the following code could be inserted before calling `SQLFORM.grid`, to ignore the order if an invalid value is provided.

```
if request.vars.order is not None:
    try:
        table, field = request.vars.order.split(""."")

Or at least we should add a more detailed message then ""invalid function (default/myfunc)""... Something did you move this function from another controller if so, did you think to update cache if this function was cached previously.

Someone can reproduce this issue by creating a dummy() function with a cache decorator. Access the function view/page with a browser to load it in cache then move this function into another controller file (even without cache decorator) and access the page witht the proper controller file name... He will recieve invalid function and the controller specify will be the previous controller instead of the new controller.

Because concurrent requests are possible, e.g. the following can happen:
1. Request 1 begins, Session is retrieved from DB.
2. Request 2 begins, Session is retrieved from DB.
3. R1 stores r1key = r1value in the Session.
4. R1 ends, Session is stored to DB
5. R2 stores r2key = r2value in the Session.
6. R2 ends, Session is stored to DB.

In the end the session does not actually contain r1key, only r2key.

This can easily happen, for example, with CSRF keys when the user opens multiple records for editing in separate tabs from a table record listing. When the user tries to save their changes (not all at once), they may be silently discarded as the CSRF key was not found in the DB anymore (related: is the silency on purpose?).

In GAE, with the lowest instance class F1, just moderate complexity will result in requests taking hundreds of milliseconds, so there is quite a large window for the issue to trigger.

I'm not immediately sure what exactly could or should be done for this. At minimum it should be documented, though.

I configured the web2py [handlers/wsgihandler.py](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/master/handlers/wsgihandler.py) as recommended by Dreamhost users (adding lines to launch python in a virtual environment), creating passenger_wsgi.py.  With just these edits, Passenger reported a timeout error from the application (web2py).  

The Passenger [debugging startup page](https://github.com/phusion/passenger/wiki/Debugging-application-startup-problems) notes that Passenger uses stdout for communication with the application and assumes that it is not ""closed, overwritten, or redirected"" by the application.  

Web2py overwrites stdout with stderr on line 31 in wsgihandler.py.  When I comment out this line, web2py (and Passenger) startup just fine and seem to work, although I haven't done much testing beyond startup.

So, my question is, is this line necessary?  If so, is there a fix to make this setup work properly?  If web2py requires both file descriptors pointing to the same place, maybe set stderr = stdout instead?

1397,Massive memory leak in Scheduler with PostgreSQL,2016-07-18T19:09:13Z,2016-07-25T08:58:56Z,,,,"When you run Web2Py scheduler on PostgreSQL, you'll get massive memory leak to the tune of 1GB RAM consumed in 48 hours. The problem is not really a bug as such but rather a horrible design mismatch between PyDAL and the pg8000 driver.

Long story short, pg8000 driver supports multiple user-friendly placeholder formats for query arguments and converts them to the format supported by PosgreSQL server. It also expects that the number of unique query strings will be fairly limited (because the arguments will be passed separately) and stores the converted query strings and some other computationally expensive metadata in cache.

Meanwhile, PyDAL happily dumps all arguments into the query string itself, which means that every single scheduler heartbeat will turn into a unique query string and bloat the pg8000 cache.

This patch is a dirty workaround that disables pg8000 query cache. The correct solution would be rewriting PyDAL to pass query arguments through placeholders. Otherwise you're giving up a pretty big performance boost.

1396,webclient.py parse cookies fails if multiple cookies,2016-07-18T16:32:20Z,2016-07-29T13:54:02Z,,,,"The issue is with this code in gluon/contrib/webclient.py:

Previously all cookies in the 'set-cookie' header were stored in self.cookies. I don't know enough about the purpose behind that change to recommend a fix. However, just indenting the last line of that sample code solves the problem but that may be introducing side effects I am unaware of.

1394,Error message when not including necessary fields in SQLFORM.grid,2016-07-16T22:03:35Z,,,,,"When passing the `fields` argument to `SQLFORM.grid`, you'll receive an empty `KeyError` if you include a virtual field which required a real field to be present but it's not included in the list. For example.

```
db.define_table(""my_table"",
    Field(""real_field""),
    Field.Virtual(""virtual_field"", lambda row: row.my_table.real_field)
```

And somewhere else:

```
SQLFORM.grid(query, fields=[db.my_table.virtual_field])
```

This raises an empty `KeyError` (since `virtual_field` needs `real_field` to be present), which is caused by the line 2752 inside `sqlhtml.py`:

```
value = row[str(field)]
```

Maybe that line could be wrapped by a `try/except KeyError` and show the proper error message.

1383,Fixed open redirect security vulnerability ,2016-06-30T21:35:20Z,2016-07-01T07:22:57Z,,,,"The previous filter searched for two forward slashes ""//"" in the ""_next” parameter and if the two forward slashes were found it would check the URI and determine if the hostname matched the hostname of the web server. If the hostname did not match, it would change the ""next"" variable to the None. However, browsers don't require two forward slashes. As a feature, browsers accept typos such as http:google.com or http:/google.com and redirect to http://google.com. This can be used to leverage an open redirect attack even with the current filter. This commit fixes the open redirect vulnerability in the _next get parameter. Thanks to jnbrex for helping debug/write the patch for this vulnerability.

Note: when testing this vulnerability, you must change the protocol in the URI. For example: if you are hosting the site using http, your redirect must go to a https site. Furthermore: http://web2py.com?_next=https:/malicioussite.com

Why? fpdf has created a file ""arialnb.pkl"" and this file contains the **absolute path**

**The best solution would be not to use an absolute path.**

                ttf = TTFontFile()

change to:

```

            if os.path.exists(unifilename):

            if not ttffile_found:  <<##########
                ttf = TTFontFile()

1355,RedisCache fails to delete cached objects when f=None,2016-06-09T19:08:57Z,2016-07-01T06:56:03Z,,,,"For background, see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/web2py/1LoXXrPlIGE/bX2u3CJ2BQAJ.

According to the book, calling `cache.model(key, f=None)` should cause `key` to be deleted from the cache. However, in `gluon.contrib.redis_cache.RedisClient.__call__`, setting `f=None` only deletes the cached object if it has expired.

This causes a problem with `@cache.action` because it relies on the `f=None` deletion method to delete pages that were cached with an invalid HTTP status.

We should change the behavior of the Redis cache to match that of the other cache models (i.e., setting `f=None` should _always_ delete the key from the cache).

Also, for extra safety, perhaps `@cache.action` should delete pages with an invalid status via `cache_model.clear(r'^%s$' % cache_key)` rather than `cache_model(cache_key, None)`.

- [x] gluon/contrib/gateways/fcgi.py _those changes IMHO will break something in 2.7 . Given the rise of uwsgi and scgi we should instead rely on the new (and supported) fcgi which in turn depends on flup. A fat warning stating that users relying on fcgi would need flup (which for python/fastcgi hosters is ALWAYS included) would seal the deal_
- [x] gluon/contrib/login_methods/ldap_auth.py _""if type(allowed_groups) != type(list()):"" got translated to ""if not isinstance(allowed_groups, type(list()))"" . **fixed**
- [x] gluon/globals.py _given the importance of the module, remember to put those #FIXME for py3 in the ""let's discuss"" recap (or clarify what is left to be decided)_
- [x] gluon/highlight.py _nothing breaks 2.7 but cgi.escape should be addressed for 3.x_
- [x] gluon/languages.py _I'd drop iterkeys() alltogether: it doesn't have any improvement over keys() or just the ""dry"" ""for key in dict"" syntax_
- [x] gluon/shell.py as contrib/shell.py: _to me those replacement are not 1:1 . That being said it's on the doctest part which is by far the least utilized part of shell.py_
- [x] gluon/utf8.py  _repr_escape_tab[i] = ur'\x%02x' % i_ **fixed**

**maybe valid, but change in behaviour**
- [x] IS_LENGTH() ?
- [ ] _uwsgi/fgci, nowadays is it visible to support only the former?_ don't think so.

**curiosity**
- [x] adding current.response.static_version = None on test_router : did some behaviour change ? **test order changed**

- [x] checking response.json() #1337
- [x] remember #fixmes in gluon/globals.py
- [x] DAL routine tests should be fixed **waiting for #1361**
- [x] IS_IP\* validators could use the ipaddress library (mostly because it's included in 3 and there is an official backport for 2.7) instead of ipaddr-py from google
- [x] on the CHANGELOG should also be reported as the very first warning that web2py DOES NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING BUT 2.7 (i.e. not only we don't officially support 2.6 but also
  we introduced changes that will surely break running on 2.6)
- [ ] We may consider adding a CHANGELOG entry for brave users to test 3.5 and report back findings
- [x] gluon/recfile.py _it has to do with the initial design concept, nothing will break 2.7 but we should really be concerned about relying on auto-closing the stream (py3 will emits warnings about it)_
- [ ] unrelated to py2, but use SemVer v2 as discussed at length on the group-chat a few months ago (PEP-440)
- [ ] fix docstring for python 3 (ex.: print something -> print(something))

**things to remember 2nd, AFTER merging this but BEFORE advertising py3 support**
- [x] aes.py ~~@leonelcamara has a solution already~~ moved to pyaes
- [x] cache.disk on win was cited by @leonelcamara, although it seems fixed already
- [x] utf8.py dependency
- [ ] gluon/contrib/login_methods/x509_auth.py _won't work with py3, another method is needed_
- [ ] gluon/tools.py : _again, m2crypto is not available for py3_
- [ ] FIX contrib.minify
- [x] gluon/contrib/shell.py _smells funny, but this would be the 312098312 time we say web shell should not be used. Next release would probably be a REEEEEEALLY good time to drop from the admin app and let the contrib module with a big ""won't ever FIX""_
- [x] gluon/contrib/websocket_messaging.py _won't certainly break 2.7, but I'm not sure it can be considered py3 safe_ **is not py3 ready yet**
- [ ] gluon/contrib/redis_scheduler.py ~~port over cronline feature~~ **and think about travis-ci tests with redis**
- [ ] execute the entire test suite on 3.5 
- [x] enable appveyor too on 3.5
- [x] fix all dependencies --> make the web2py release fully py3 compliant
- [x] fix https://github.com/web2py/web2py/issues/1403

            else:
                del kwargs[key]
```

The problem is that some of the arguments in the list above are dictionaries themselves (e.g., exportclasses, formargs, etc.), so if they are submitted on their own (i.e., not nested in a dictionary whose keys are table names), they will pass the `isinstance` test and ultimately get deleted in the `else` block.

As an alternative, maybe we can test not only whether a given kwarg is a dictionary, but that _all_ of its keys are table names:

```
    if isinstance(kwargs.get(key, None), dict) and all([k in table._db for k in kwargs[key]]):
```

If all the keys of the dictionary are names of tables in the db, then we can assume it is meant as a dictionary containing a separate argument for each table. Otherwise, we assume the argument itself is supposed to be a dictionary and let it pass through as is.

The above is just a heuristic, though. I suppose it could break down with something like `formargs`, where someone might include just a single form argument in the dictionary that happens to have the same name as one of their database tables. For a more exact approach, I suppose we could identify all the arguments that are expected to be dictionaries, and test whether they are dictionaries of dictionaries before passing them through this block of code.

1323,Cannot queue tasks from the web2py shell,2016-05-07T06:04:08Z,2016-05-09T19:22:09Z,,,,"This has been tested on the following two versions of web2py

Below are the contents of my db.py file:

<pre>from gluon.scheduler import Scheduler
db = DAL('mysql://web2py:baadal@10.0.0.111/web2py')
  scheduler = Scheduler(db)

      import time
      with file('/tmp/test', 'w') as f:
          f.writelines(time.asctime())`
</pre>


and from the shell I try to queue the task like so:

<pre>scheduler.queue_task(task, repeats=5, period=30)</pre>


But this doesn't work. Upon inspection I found that the entry for the task was not being
created in the scheduler_task table.

However, making the same call from a controller or a model works fine.

Another thing noticed was that scheduled tasks are not run strictly according to the specified.
Although, I set the task to run every 30 seconds, the gap between two consecutive runs was
anything between 0 seconds to one minute.

1321,fixed timing attack in gluon.utils.compare,2016-05-06T18:43:48Z,2016-05-09T05:04:39Z,,,,"[Timing Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack) are a class of side channel attacks in which information is leaked from systems through differences in timing. gluon.utils.compare is designed to resist timing attacks by forcing constant-time character comparisons on the inputs, but leaks information about the relative length inputs by exiting early when lengths differ.

This patch mitigates the information leak by registering early failure when lengths differ, but still executing over the arguments. Choosing one argument to make the ""max length"" is necessary, but essentially arbitrary for a single set of arguments. Across multiple sets of arguments, it is preferable to use the attacker's value to avoid exposing differences in relative length between defender values. Current code appears to use the second argument for checking user-supplied values, so it was designated the ""attacker"" value and drives the number of comparisons.

1300,should auth.add_membership() succeed?,2016-04-17T14:29:28Z,2016-08-25T05:12:51Z,,NOTE,NOTE: I had search tools.py for any use of add_membership() like that : ,"Here :

And here:

We don't enforce required=True, notnull=True and requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY() or even better requires=IS_IN_DB(db, 'auth_user.id')

Why?

And does it makes any sens that auth.add_membership() return an membership id when it actually insert an empty record?

``` python
In [2]: auth.is_logged_in()
Out[2]: True

In [3]: auth.has_membership('user_1')
Out[3]: True

In [4]: auth.has_membership('blabla')
Out[4]: False

Out[5]: 2L

In [6]: db.auth_membership(2)
Out[6]: <Row {'group_id': None, 'user_id': 1L, 'id': 2L}>

In [7]: db(db.auth_group.id > 0).select().first()
Out[7]: <Row {'auth_permission': <Set (auth_permission.group_id = 1)>, 'description': '', 'role': 'user_1', 'auth_membership': <Set (auth_membership.group_id = 1)>, 'id': 1L}>

In [8]: db(db.auth_group.id > 0).select()
Out[8]: <Rows (1)>
```

NOTE: I had search tools.py for any use of add_membership() like that : 

``` python
membership_id = self.auth.add_membership('some_group')
```

And didn't find anythings that could cause a real issue... But I don't think that add_membership() should ""fail"" silently or add useless membership record...

This works well, when no `selectable` option is used. However, when I use the `selectable` option, the `<colgroup>` generatad does not change while in fact the number of columns in the table changes. This results in wrong styles being applied to wrong columns. Tested in R-2.13.4 and in the latest trunk (pulled just now). 

It seems to be sufficient to add one more value in `<colgroup>` for the new first column, when `selectable` option is used.

1261, security issue: gluon.tools.Expose will follow symlinks,2016-04-03T12:36:35Z,2016-06-13T04:09:59Z,,,,"Consider `controller/default.py` with:

If a user can gain write access to `/tmp` and can perform `ln -s /etc /tmp/link-to-etc`, expose_tmp_folder will happily follow that link and expose `/etc` as well.

I suggest to examine the symlink and allow it only if the target is also under base.

I attach my solution as a patch. I don't do this as a pull request because I haven't tested it sufficiently.

Examining `mercurial.scmutil.addremove()` shows the following signature.

So, what is here:
1. newer cs.py in admin and welcome.
2. script to set untranslated messages in translation file from another one (if you want update application file from newer version of welcome file, if you start translation for very similar language, and so on).
3. nginx/uwsgi/ubuntu script for systemd (creates /etc/systemd/system/emperor.uwsgi.service as described here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/ZM9IIEjtHSI + uses: service..start/service..stop)
   This worked good for me at forpsi virtual debian 8.
   However I am not good in shell scripting. So some review and testing here would be good. But no idea how to do it.
   Especially mkdir commands: what happens if directories already exist. I think it generates no fatal failure, but warnings.

No problem if something or all is acceptable. It is just first attempt with pull request here.
If later I will sure create separate pieces.

1198,strange behaviour SQLFORM.factory when edit,2016-02-29T20:27:56Z,2016-03-01T11:27:27Z,,,,"Hi,

I am using SQLFORM.factory to update 2 tables at the same time. The issue is when I am trying to edit the form with the info I have already in the database, for 'list:string' and 'upload' types. SQLFORM.factory does not display these types as SQLFORM do.  For the next example I am using one table, due to it is the same behaviour. 

In model I have the next table:

```
 db.define_table('car',
            Field('name', 'string'),
            Field('picture', 'upload'),
            Field('color', ""list:string"", requires=IS_IN_SET(('red','blue'))),
            Field('tag','list:string'),
            Field('extras', ""list:string"", requires=IS_IN_SET(self._get_extras(), multiple=True)),
```

Now from a controller I do:

```
# Get the ID, and look into the database for the info to display
form = SQLFORM.factory(db.car)
form.vars.name = row.name
form.vars.picture = row.picture
form.vars.color = row.color
form.vars.tag = row.tag
form.vars.extras = row.extras
return dict(form=form)
```

The result is:
- For `name` it works. It appears the input field with the current value in the database.
- For `extras`, it works as expected.
- For `picture`, It does not display the picture, and the form ask you to upload again.
- For `color`, It does not display the current data and it force to select one more time one option.
- For `tag`, It does not display the current data, so even you can not delete the tags you have created before.

Is this the expected behaviour for SQLFORM.factory? is there another way to edit info with SQLFORM.factory or update several tables at the same time?

                   f=f, args=args, vars=vars, scheme=scheme)

here scheme if true uses host header to generate urls that is bad.

possible solution
file: gluon/tools.py

``` python
    def url(self, f=None, args=None, vars=None, scheme=False):
        if args is None:

also add the setting for host_name variable in Auth class

``` python
class Auth(object):
    default_settings = dict(

        cas_maps=None,
        host_name = '',
        reset_password_requires_verification=False,
```

Now this variable can be set in db.py
file: db.py

``` python
auth.settings.host_name = myconf.take('host.hostname')
```

and then host_name can be abstracted in appconfig.ini

file: appconfig.ini

``` shell

hostname = www.google.com

A fix would be for `Auth.get_or_create_user` to pass a `Storage` object with a `.vars` attribute containing the `user` Row object (which includes the `id` field).

I believe that there is a bug in gluon/scheduler.py which is causing tasks that utilize the Prevent Drift option to run repeatedly when a run fails. Prevent Drift utilizes a times_run variable when calculating when the next run should occur, however when tasks do not complete successfully this count does not currently get incremented which means that the next run time doesn't get moved forward and thus the task just gets picked up again almost immediately.  Review of the relevant source code suggests to me that the error is occurring in the section between lines 911 and 932 and that a new line should be inserted between lines 930 & 931 to update the times_run value as is done on line 914 for successful runs.

1178,LDAP / AD Login method updating Auth table issue.,2016-02-02T15:45:05Z,2016-02-09T09:13:23Z,,,,"Currently with LDAP / AD when I have user sign in it create two rows in the auth table records.
Users would have to sign in initally and log out and log back in for the application to have group records  and such attached to the appropriate auth record.

Previously worked @ ver. 2.12.3

please see the following for additional details: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/o2BY16DPVZM 

What I did to resolve was:

ldap_auth.py ~line 425 added "" 'username': username "" to the ""update_or_insert_values"" dictionary 

update_or_insert_values = {'first_name': store_user_firstname,
                                           'last_name': store_user_lastname,
                                           'email': store_user_mail,
                                           'username': username}

ldap_auth.py ~line 429 added "" ,'username' "" to the fields array

fields = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'email','username']

After that only 1 row is created.   And a new single sign in works without the need to log out and back in.

I am not a programming method wizard.  I don't know how this fix affects the other methods besides 'ad' in the LDAP module as what I changed is in the scope of the 'if manage_user:' block ~line 402

text variables to unicode.

After merging it, matclab realized that when we send Unicode
text to the method it raises an exception and asked if he should
change the commit. Unfortunately this thing was kept untouched.

This problem exists because we previously encode the unicode variables
to utf-8 (for instance here https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/master/gluon/tools.py#L478-L481) 
and then convert to unicode again. This piece of code shows the exception being raised:

```

1158,new redis toolset to use with web2py,2016-01-02T22:15:41Z,2016-01-04T15:43:58Z,,,,"This is a refactor of everything web2py uses with redis.
Specifically:
- a refactored redis_cache.py that fixes #958, allowing a ""fail
  gracefully"" behaviour in case redis is not available
- a refactored redis_session.py that blocks less with with_lock=True
  (although still not optimal)
- a new (and NEEDED) redis_utils.py that serves as the base for
  everything else, allowing an RConn object that you can freely use as a
  redis.StrictRedis connection, and that you can override in case you're
  using a different library (or that web2py will use in case redis-py
  won't be the de-facto standard around)
- a newly - and much anticipated - redis_scheduler.py. It's a slip-in
  replacement for the standard scheduler that uses redis for workers
  coordination. Feel free to dig in the code and improve it.

For redis_cache and redis_session changes are BREAKING. It means that
users will need to change the import locations and tune a bit the code.
Now every module depends on an gluon.contrib.redis_utils.RConn object
(or similar) that in turns is very similar to a redis.StrictRedis one.
The redis instance is EXTERNAL to the modules themselves (no more ""host,
port, db, password"" parameters in RedisCache or RedisSession)

I want to expose an couchbase bucket where I save some XML files generated in my web2py controller. I know I could maybe use MongoDB but I had a requirement for using Couchbase.

Is there an official connector for Couchbase? I couldn't find it in the DAL documentation. 

I am trying this working around:

```
from couchbase import Couchbase
cb = Couchbase.connect(bucket='mybucket', host='localhost', port=8091)
#this works but we got a message saying it is depreciated
# DeprecationWarning: Couchbase.connect() is deprecated. Use Bucket() instead
```

But I got a message saying it is depreciated and I should use this instead:

```
cb = Bucket(bucket='mybucket', host='localhost', port=8091)
```

But then I got an error:

```
<type 'exceptions.NameError'> name 'Bucket' is not defined
```

Any other suggestion , workarounds on Web2Py connecting to couchbase, specially for being exposed by an API? Thanks!

fields = self._defaults(fields)

because driving_time does have a default value, self._defaults returns the field and thus it does not get computed further on.

the default value for driving_time does not really make sense here (I added it out of habit) but it definitely should not stop it from getting computed.

However, if the -f startup option is used to specify a different location for the `applications` directory, then web2py loads the root file, but afterwards looks for the `routes.py` file in that new location instead of the usual root location.  When it does not find the file in the new location, it falls back to out-of-the-box routing defaults (e.g. goes to welcome app) and  ignores the settings in the `routes.py` file that exists in the web2py root directory.

Another observation is that web2py places the `httpserver.pid` and `parameters_NNNN.py` files in this new directory, whereas those files (should?) normally be in the web2py root directory as well.

Observe the 2 rewrite messages below on server startup and which `routes.py` it is using (1st one is root path, 2nd is applications path as passed with -f option):

Not only is this detrimental to bug-hunting – it took me a long time to realise that I was passing the wrong arguments to the validator – but it's also not clear to someone using validators for the first time that this isn't just ""what happens"" when a validator rejects input. My first thought was simply that the exception should be caught, and then manual form error processing should be done.

1100,Make disabling of form submit buttons optional,2015-11-07T15:50:48Z,2016-01-04T15:41:44Z,,,,"Whenever a form is submitted, code in web2py.js causes the submit button to be disabled. For Ajax submissions, the button is re-enabled after completion of the Ajax request. However, for non-Ajax requests, the button is never re-enabled. This is generally not a problem, as in most cases, the pages is immediately replaced with a new page from the server. However, if the form submission instead triggers the return of a file attachment, the original page is not replaced, and the button remains disabled. (See further details https://groups.google.com/d/msg/web2py/VH6H0OlyYd0/BDOmqkWQCQAJ.)

We should add an option to prevent the automatic disabling of submit buttons (e.g., by adding a special class or data attribute flag). Additionally, for non-Ajax requests, we could add a timer, re-enabling the button automatically after a couple seconds.

1095,Two-factor authentication improvement and bug fixed,2015-10-29T17:12:29Z,2015-12-04T17:29:42Z,,,,"Working in the next patch:

When two-factor authentication is enables it looks that the last retry (last attempt to introduce the code) does not have effect. It did not have effect because the redirect and clean sessions is performed before to form.accepts. In the patch have been fixed.

I have done a few modification in tools.py to have two-factor more flexible, from models it is possible to do:

Enable two factor as global settings. It is compatible:

```
auth.setting.auth_two_factor_enabled = False
```

Set your custom attempts to login:

```
auth.setting.auth_two_factor_tries_left = 3
```

Message to return in case the code is incorrect:

```
auth.messages..invalid_two_factor_code = 'Incorrect code. {0} more attempt(s) remaining.'
```

To customize the email template:

```
auth.messages.retrieve_two_factor_code='Your temporary login code is {0}'
auth.messages.retrieve_two_factor_code_subject='Your temporary login code is {0}'
```

To customize two factor form:

```
auth.messages.label_two_factor = 'Authentication code'
auth.messages.two_factor_comment = 'This code was emailed to you and is required for login.'
```

It can be used to customize how to send the two factor code, or even to create your own factor code:

```
auth.settings.two_factor_methods = []
```

Once the two factor code is submit, you can use:

```
auth.settings.two_factor_onvalidation = []
```

By default if  `auth.settings.two_factor_authentication_group` is used or `auth.setting.auth_two_factor_enabled` is enable the code is generated as before and it is sent by email. The next examples are compatible with  two_factor_authentication_group or  `auth_two_factor_enabled`. The only difference is that  auth_two_factor_enabled enable two-factor for the entire app, instead to use groups.

Example 1: We want to send the code by SMS, in our models:

```
def _sendsms(user, auth_two_factor):
    # we write the code to send the auth_two_factor by SMS
    return  auth_two_factor

auth.settings.auth_two_factor_tries_left = 2
auth.settings.auth_two_factor_enabled = True
auth.messages.two_factor_comment = ""Your code have been sent by SMS""
auth.settings.two_factor_methods = [lambda user, auth_two_factor: _sendsms(user, auth_two_factor)]
```

Example 2: We want to send the code by SMS and create or own code:

```
def _sendsms(user, auth_two_factor):
    auth_two_factor = # we write the code to generate the code
    # we write the code to send the auth_two_factor by SMS
    return  auth_two_factor

auth.settings.auth_two_factor_tries_left = 2
auth.settings.auth_two_factor_enabled = True
auth.messages.two_factor_comment = ""Your code have been sent by SMS""
auth.settings.two_factor_methods = [lambda user, auth_two_factor: _sendsms(user, auth_two_factor)]
```

Example 3: The code is generated by a external client. For example OTP Client:

```
#Before define tables, we add some extra field to auth_user
auth.settings.extra_fields['auth_user'] = [
    Field('motp_secret', 'password', length=512, default='', label='MOTP Secret'),
    Field('motp_pin', 'string', length=128, default='', label='MOTP PIN')]

OFFSET = 60 #Be sure is the same in your OTP Client

#Set session.auth_two_factor to None. Because the code is generated by external app. 
# This will avoid to use the default setting and send a code by email.
def _set_two_factor(user, auth_two_factor):
    return None

def verify_otp(user, otp):
  import time
  from hashlib import md5
  epoch_time = int(time.time())
  time_start = int(str(epoch_time - OFFSET)[:-1])
  time_end = int(str(epoch_time + OFFSET)[:-1])
  for t in range(time_start - 1, time_end + 1):
     to_hash = str(t) + user.motp_secret + user.motp_pin
     hash = md5(to_hash).hexdigest()[:6]
     if otp == hash:
       return hash

auth.settings.auth_two_factor_enabled = True
auth.messages.two_factor_comment = ""Verify your OTP Client for the code.""
auth.settings.two_factor_methods = [lambda user, auth_two_factor: _set_two_factor(user, auth_two_factor)]
auth.settings.two_factor_onvalidation = [lambda user, otp: verify_otp(user, otp)]

1094,IS_DATETIME with timezone info & record versioning causes TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes,2015-10-27T15:12:55Z,2015-12-04T17:32:21Z,,,,"Web2py Version 2.12.2-stable+timestamp.2015.08.09.14.29.44

The IS_DATETIME validator creates an offset-aware datetime in https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/master/gluon/validators.py#L2190

``` python
value = self.timezone.localize(value).astimezone(utc)
```

which causes the TypeError in:
dal\pydal\helpers\methods.py, line 95, in archive_record
https://github.com/web2py/pydal/blob/600c8dc0acc7552a9a7570aeae70b2eed8321f52/pydal/helpers/methods.py#L95

``` python
if fields[k] != v:
```

This happens when you have a writable datetime field and edit it with a SQLFORM. The validator is called, leading to an offset-aware datetime in the row object causing the TypeError exception.

Possible fix is to normalize the offset-aware datetime back to a naive datetime object:

``` python
value = self.timezone.localize(value).astimezone(utc).replace(tzinfo=None)
```

This means that if you want to use a condition {{extend}} in a single view, you cannot compile the app at all. Instead, we should allow the rest of the app to compile, with just the failed views remaining uncompiled.

I submitted a patch for this a long time ago (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/web2py-developers/GhvqakUaujA/iTj0_uP76XcJ), but it was never applied. At this point, it may need to be tweaked, but since we now allow Python expressions in the {{extend}} statement, it makes sense to allow this.

1074,DIV.elements fails when searching for an attribute with an integer value,2015-09-22T18:05:47Z,2015-12-04T18:21:40Z,,,,"Given:

```
mydiv = DIV('hello', _id=1)
```

All of the following will fail to return a result:

```
mydiv.elements('#1')
mydiv.elements(_id=1)
mydiv.elements(_id='1')
```

However, the following will work:

```
mydiv.elements(_id=re.compile('1'))
```

This is because at [this line](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/6ecc147d8c32448ab5e4999f20968fa122be37bd/gluon/html.py#L1138):

```
                if self[key] != str(value):
```

the `str` function is applied to the argument passed to `.elements`, but that string representation is then compared to the original attribute value (which is an integer in this case).

A fix would be to change the above line to:

```
                if str(self[key]) != str(value):
```

Alternatively, if for some reason we want to preserve the distinction between int and string values of the original attributes, then the line could be changed to:

```
                if self[key] != value:
```

I think the first approach (i.e., converting everything to string representations) is probably preferable, particularly since it is consistent with the approach taken when the argument to `.elements` is a regular expression, which can be seen at [this line](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/6ecc147d8c32448ab5e4999f20968fa122be37bd/gluon/html.py#L1141):

```
                if not value.search(str(self[key])):
```

In this case, the original attribute value is first converted to its string representation.

Note, this issue arose in the context of the web2py grid, which uses integer id's in each row of the HTML table. Hence, something like `grid.element('#1')` would fail to return the `TR` of the first record. For some discussion, see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/WJ3PW3voQFU.

1059,`response.render()` uses the original `response.view`,2015-09-03T23:38:07Z,2015-09-18T05:40:05Z,,,,"## The problem

When using `response.render()`, Web2py works fine for the first request. But it uses wrong view name in subsequent requests.

My same code worked in v2.9.11.
## The scenario

I use views to render parts of my page in this way:

```
def my_action():
    my_div = response.render('div_layout.html')
    # more code...
    return dict(my_div=my_div, other_vars=...)
```

Web2py must use these views:
1. `div_layout.html` in the explicit `response.render()` call;
2. `my_action.html` to show the result of this action, after returning to the caller.
## What is happening

The right scenario (the first time I call the URL):

| `response.view` contents | when |
| --- | --- |
| my_controller/my_view.html | `my_action` starts |
| div_layout.html | in `response.render` |
| my_controller/my_view.html | in `compileapp.run_view_in()`, after `my_action` |

The wrong scenario (in subsequent requests. Pay attention to the second line in table below):

| `response.view` contents | when |
| --- | --- |
| my_controller/my_view.html | `my_action` starts |
| my_controller/my_view.html | in `response.render` |
| my_controller/my_view.html | in `compileapp.run_view_in()`, after `my_action` |

1041,Possible bug in 2.12.2 when including a .css file in a HTML email template,2015-08-12T08:49:21Z,2015-12-04T18:35:00Z,,,,"Hi,

I've just updated my project to Web2py 2.12.2 and found a little issue that wasn't there in my previouse versie 2.10.something...

I render a HTML template for the 'reset password' email like this:

```
auth.messages.reset_password = response.render('templates/email/reset_password.html',
                                               base_url='http://' + request.env.http_host,
                                               portal_name=site_settings.portal_name,
                                               password_url=URL(r=request, c='default', f='choose_new_password') + '?key=%(key)s')
```

The template itself looks like this:

```
<html>
    <head>
       {{include 'templates/email/includes/css.html'}}
   </head>

    {{include 'templates/email/includes/body_top.html'}}
        <p>
            Click on the URL
            <a href=""{{=base_url}}{{=password_url}}"">{{=base_url}}{{=password_url}}</a>
        </p>
    {{include 'templates/email/includes/body_bottom.html'}}
</html>
```

After disabling the includes and partial css format in the css.html I've discovered that the following lines in css.html:

```
<style type=""text/css"">
    table {
        width: 100%;
        border-collapse: collapse;
    }
</style>
```

Is causing this error:

```
unsupported format character ';' (0x3b) at index 397
```

When I change ""100%;"" into, for example, ""100px;"" the error is gone... downside it that the layout of the email is also 'gone' ;)

It this a bug? Or do I need to do things differently and did is work by accident in previous versions of Web2Py?

1039,request.is_shell and request.is_scheduler are not set properly,2015-08-10T18:32:11Z,2015-09-27T19:40:14Z,,,,"When the shell or scheduler are being run, these two request attributes are set, but not to the correct value (which should be False rather than None). And when the shell or scheduler are being run, these two attributes are not set at all (which results in None being returned). So, as it stands, request.is_shell and request.is_scheduler always return None.

The problem is that these attributes are set in gluon.main.wsgibase, which is only called for HTTP requests, but not when the shell or a scheduler task are being run.

Fix:

In gluon.main.wsgibase at https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/master/gluon/main.py#L373:

```
                is_shell = True if cmd_opts and cmd_opts.shell else False,
                is_sheduler = True if cmd_opts and cmd_opts.scheduler else False,
```

Actually, in wsgibase, I think these would always be False, so maybe just set each to False.

In gluon.shell.env at https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/master/gluon/shell.py#L131, add:

```
request.is_shell = global_settings.cmd_options.shell is not None
request.is_scheduler = global_settings.cmd_options.scheduler is not None

I've notices an issue with the add_group function, in my models i have a configuration file that creates groups every time the database is created, something like this:

if not db(db.auth_group).count():
    auth.add_group('manager', 'manage user stuff')

and when in try to run my app without tables (the app creating the tables for first time) i get this error:

i've been testing and this error happens because when the application creates a new group via add_group, tries to create a event inside the auth_event table, but one of the field of the auth_event table points to auth_user, and auth_user at table creation is empty, so doesnt exist any foreign key that the app cant set to that field

1034,Error in DB2 for system i Adapter when inserting record into table defined in specific library,2015-08-03T10:52:21Z,2015-12-04T18:36:34Z,DAL,,,"Hi everybody.
I have a table in a IBM system i database. The table is located in a specific library, so I defined it in web2py this way:
`
db.define_table(
    'table', rname='LIBRARY.TABLE',
    fields = {
        ... field list...
    },
    migrate=False
)
`
The library name in the rname attribute is necessary because the ODBC driver configuration has no default libraries, and different tables are located in different libraries.

Querying and updating the table works as it should, but when I attempted to insert a record into the table, i got this error:

**<class 'pyodbc.ProgrammingError'> ('42S02', '[42S02] [IBM][System i Access ODBC Driver][DB2 for i5/OS]SQL0204 - TABLE in LIBRARY2 di tipo *FILE non trovato. (-204) (SQLExecDirectW)')**

The source of the error is **""gluon/packages/dal/pydal/adapters/db2.py"", line 101, in lastrowid,** where the case of existing rname attribute was not taken in consideration. The solution, in my opinion, is to change said line from:
`self.execute('SELECT DISTINCT IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL() FROM %s;' % table)`
to
`self.execute('SELECT DISTINCT IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL() FROM %s;' % table.sqlsafe)`

Thank you and best regards.

to what's in the book, I replaced the code above with:

## create all tables needed by auth if not custom tables

auth.define_tables(migrate=False, username=True, signature=False)

After that the reset_password link no longer worked.  So I guess the issue is related to the way
you customize the auth_user table.

1024,"Caching recursive selects for references can lead to incorrect ""represent"" values",2015-07-17T20:36:06Z,2015-07-20T08:52:39Z,,,,"Commit https://github.com/web2py/web2py/commit/d1ec005924b10e0c738040586acaaa200db9d244 introduced caching of ""represent"" values for reference fields in SQLTABLE, SQLFORM.grid, and the grid ExportClass:

Unfortunately, this approach assumes all reference fields have the default ""represent"" function generated automatically by the DAL, which depends only on the ID value stored in the reference field and not on any other fields in the record. As a result, the cache key used to identify common ""represent"" values is based only on the reference field value itself. This approach fails if the user has defined a custom ""represent"" function that depends on other fields in the record.

For example, suppose we have:

```
db.mytable.myref.represent = lambda v, r: A(v.some_field, _href=URL('edit_record', r.id))
```

If the first record of mytable has values {id: 1, myref: 5}, then the value A(..., _href=URL('edit_record', 1)) will be stored in repr_cache['myref'][5] .

Now if a subsequent record has values {id: 10, myref: 5}, then the value stored in repr_cache['myref'][5] will be retrieved (because the value 5 of the represent field matches the cache key from the earlier record), but it will be incorrect, because the correct value should be A(..., _href=URL('edit_record', 10)).

The problem is that the key (5 in this case) does not uniquely identify the returned value of the represent function, which depends not only on the value 5, but also on the value of r.id.

This feature should either be reverted or fixed to accommodate custom ""represent"" functions.

Here is it.
### first try

When i hit the create button use the name 'one' in 'site' page, which give me this:

``` python
  File ""/Users/gavin/code/open_source/web2py/gluon/packages/dal/pydal/adapters/base.py"", line 737, in insert
    raise e
ValueError: INSERT INTO appcreate(name) VALUES ('one');
```

I have no idea what's wrong , but i thought there could be a folder created by web2py, but i was wrong. Then let's debug it.
### try again

I put a 'import pdb;pdb.set_trace()'  under the function site() in applications/admin/controllers/default.py  , which gave me this:

``` bash
(Pdb) Tcl_WaitForEvent: Notifier not initialized
```

Then i relized that Tkinter is running and pdb will not function.And i have no experience using TKinter, so i give up.
### third try

I find a command-line option ""-S APPNAME, --shell=APPNAME"" will create the app if not exist , looks great , which turn out drive me crazy......
The program is not working when i hit ENTER, it shows in the terminal like this:

``` bash

application one does not exist, create (y/n)?y^M^M^M
```

what???
I don't know if that was my shell's wrong configation or what?
### another try?

I'm going insane...
The only way i can thought now is try a NON-GUI start up and put pdb in the code like my second try, which is a way to go and what i'm doing now...
The command is 

``` bash
 python web2py.py --nogui -a '111111'
```

-a set the admin password

I'm just not comfortable with a vary start like this, and NOT EASY for me...
So, please anybody can tell me what is the problem? 
And if there is a debug mode for easy develop?
And what if i dont't want the admin way to develop my application?

The particular issue is that the postgres adapter with psychopg2 returns a unicode for expressions, which then breaks BaseAdapter.expand for all WHERE expressions containing non-ASCII characters:

In adapters/postgres.py:

```
def adapt(self, obj):
    if self.driver_name == 'psycopg2':
        rv = psycopg2_adapt(obj).getquoted()
        if isinstance(rv, bytes):
            return rv.decode(""utf8"") # <= here, returns a unicode
        return rv
    elif self.driver_name == 'pg8000':
        return ""'%s'"" % obj.replace(""%"", ""%%"").replace(""'"", ""''"")
    else:
        return ""'%s'"" % obj.replace(""'"", ""''"")
```

In adapters/base.py:

```
    return str(rv) # <= breaks for unicode with non-ASCII characters
```

Obviously, this is a bit of a blocker for PostgreSQL-based deployments with psychopg2 (99% of all our deployments).

A patch for Python 2.x could be this:

In adapters/postgres.py:

```
def adapt(self, obj):
    if self.driver_name == 'psycopg2':
        rv = psycopg2_adapt(obj).getquoted()
        if isinstance(rv, unicode):
            return rv.encode(self.db_codec) # <= make sure it always returns an encoded str
        return rv
    elif self.driver_name == 'pg8000':
        return ""'%s'"" % obj.replace(""%"", ""%%"").replace(""'"", ""''"")
    else:
        return ""'%s'"" % obj.replace(""'"", ""''"")
```

I've tried to report the issue to PyDAL, but there doesn't seem to be any priority for fixing this, so I was told that it will take weeks before a fix becomes available in web2py :/

Hence, question: should 2.11.1 be downgraded to the previous PyDAL release?

If there is a directory on the host within the application's directory whose name contains a space character (eg. ""/home/user/web2py/applications/example/private/a b/"") then when editing the application using the admin application in a browser (eg. https://hostname.com/admin/default/design/example), I cannot access the contents of the directory ""private/a b/"". 

In the admin application I can see under section ""Private Files"" that there is a folder named ""a b/"". However, clicking on the folder name ""a b/"" will not open up its contents, as opposed to when there's no space in the directory name.

Note: inspecting the HTML source of https://hostname.com/admin/default/design/example I can see that the contents of folder ""a b/"" are already included (""a b/test.txt""):

``` html
<li class=""folder"">
            <a href=""javascript:collapse('private__a b');"" class=""file"">a b/</a>

            </span>
        </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
```

So it seems there's a Javascript error opening that `<ul>` in the browser.

Note2: I am using a 3rd-party library in my web2py application that expects a certain directory name containing a space character so using a different name is not an option unfortunately.

972,Text that follows a double-quote inside of current.T() is chopped when used as textarea placeholder,2015-05-18T17:23:54Z,,,,,"There are cases in which text that contains double-quotes, after being passed to LazyT, is chopped, following the first double quote . The issue is described in detail in this thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/V1ichclAkaY

This is Anthony's explanation:

The problem is that there is an inconsistency with the escaping of regular strings vs. LazyT objects when serializing HTML helpers. When helpers are serialized, all attribute values are passed to gluon.html.xmlescape. In xmlescape, regular strings are ultimately passed to cgi.escape with the ""quote"" argument set to True. However, LazyT objects are not passed to cgi.escape but instead have their .xml() method called, and that method calls cgi.escape with the ""quote"" argument set to False. As a result, double quotes are not converted to ""&quot;"". This creates a problem because when helpers are serialized, all attributes are wrapped with double quotes, so you cannot have double quotes within the attribute unless they are HTML encoded. This should probably be considered a bug. Perhaps xmlescape should check for LazyT objects and instead of calling the .xml() method, treat it as a string object.

Expected behaviour was to have it fail gracefully and respond with the ""key doesn't exist"" behaviour and continue processing.

Niphlod pointed out use case for it to fail with traceback but also agrees that a flag can be added to allow user choice of failure mode on establishing the Redis connection.  For example, a new flag `fail_gracefully=True` would not cause a traceback and would respond as if key didn't exist if the redis server is unavailable.  If set to False then the traceback would occur.

There was also an issue pointed out in the connection delay on unavailable being 30 seconds before action taken, which, for the fail gracefully option should be a lot shorter (5 seconds, say).

Niphlod then pointed out that he would like to overhaul the whole Redis connection algorithm at which point the flag could be added and requested an issue be opened here.

So obviously the above passage in the book (and of course in every users installation ...) has to be changed into
`auth.messages.reset_password = 'Click on the link http://' +     request.env.http_host +     URL(r=request,c='default',f='user',args=['reset_password']) +     '?key=%(key)s to reset your password'` 

Please note the change from
    _'/%(key)s ...'_
to
    **_'?key=%(key)s ...'**_

By the way: where's the benefit in this change anyway?

940,Multiple autocomplete widgets in one form store only in one field,2015-04-23T12:42:36Z,2016-03-19T17:46:21Z,,,,"When a table has more than one field, represented using autocomplete widget, **referencing the same other table**, the generated wigets get confused in which field they have to store the result. 
When you autocomplete the second field, the result is written in the first.

Example:
`db.define_table('point',Field('name','string'))
db.define_table('route',Field('route_name','string'),
               Field('start_point','reference point',widget=SQLFORM.widgets.autocomplete( request, db.point.name, id_field=db.point.id,

Add a few points in db.point using the admin interface then try to add a route in db.route
using the same admin interface or in a controller
`def index():
    grid=SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.route,create=True,editable=True, details=True)

The javascript magic in SQLHTML.py for the fix should also contain the destination field name,  in my opinion.

Seems that any logged on user automatically has edit and manager rights to all pages without being added to auth_groups: ""wiki_editor"" and ""wiki_author"".  If I create a new fake user and they are not given admin rights, and they access the wiki page, somehow they automatically get added with ""wiki_editor"" role in auth_membership.  Could this be something weird that I've done in auth groups or something?

Am using 2.9.11-stable+timestamp.2014.09.15.23.35.11 on windows

thanks!

910,encoding error writing unicode string to postgre,2015-04-11T15:11:10Z,2015-06-17T07:02:40Z,DAL,UnicodeDecodeError,UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe1 in position 105: ordinal not in range(128),"**web2py version**: 2.10.3-stable release
**host environment**: rocket server running on Ubuntu 14.10

I'm running into an error with when I try to write unicode text (outside the Latin ranges) to a regular string field in a postgre database. Since my app is a greek language-learning application this error breaks things completely for me. 
## Unwanted behaviour

When I try, for example, to insert the string 'ἀγοραζε' I get the following error, triggered at pydal/adapters/base.py:

``` python
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File ""applications/paideia/modules/paideia.py"", line 168, in start

    raise e
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe1 in position 105: ordinal not in range(128)
```
## How to reproducing the error

I've created a simple app that duplicates the error and attached the packed app here: [web2py.app.unicode_bug_test.w2p](https://files.zenhub.io/5529368e1d1f0c3550ec51c9). After installing the sample app and setting up a postgre db for it:
1. navigate to appadmin
2. attempt to create a new record in the 'lemmas' table 
3. enter non-Latin unicode text in the 'lemma' field (something like 'βλα')
## Version where problem appeared

I'm not certain. The error isn't raised on my production server which is still running 2.9.11
## Setup for minimal sample app ""unicode_bug_test""

Since the error doesn't happen with sqlite, I've set up db to connect with a postgre database with the following connection details:

username = 'postgres'
postgre host = 'localhost'
postgre db_name = 'unicode_bug_test'

I've left the db password field empty in the db.py file for obvious reasons (i.e., my local password wouldn't do anyone any good anyway).

[web2py.app.unicode_bug_test.w2p | uploaded via ZenHub](https://files.zenhub.io/5529368e1d1f0c3550ec51c9)
## Debugging attempts so far
#### The error isn't raised when using a sqlite3 database

So it seems to be postgre specific. Maybe it's actually a problem in the pg8000 adapter?
#### The raw SQL sent by pyDAL to the adapter is fine

The SQL being sent by adapters.base.insert() to the postgre adapter was this:

``` sql
INSERT INTO attempt_log(name,user_response,step,score,modified_on,dt_attempted,in_path,uuid) VALUES (19,'ἀγοραζε',773,1.0,'2015-04-10 12:33:25','2015-04-10 16:33:26',657,'5918a65a-6d6f-42c6-9af2-f5d0e313701e') RETURNING id;
```

When I copy that SQL command into pgAdmin execute it the new row is created fine. No errors are raised.

Could we redirect admin/default/plugins to something which is easier and can be maintained?
Or solve the problem with updating sources of web2pyslices?

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/web2py/7K4hAcOiEfg/E_h0aVfk9k8J
## 

An application uses uploads_in_blob feature as follows :

```
db._adapter.uploads_in_blob = True
```

This creates an additional column of BYTEA type at the DB Level (I am using postgres, if it matters)

Each time a DB query is run (and results returned to web2py), the size of each row returned also includes the size of the uploaded document.
e.g. If each row has a document of say 5MB, then 20 rows that are returned by default pagination, consumes 100MB
(I am not sure when this memory is released/GC'ed) So after going thru say 5 such queries, memory consumed is 500MB

User may not always ""download"" the file, user may be just looking at the records' metadata, so access to the BLOB isn't needed till user clicks the download link (denoted by ""file"" URL)
When NOT using uploads_in_blob, the uploads folder only contains a filename, and the file actually resides on the disk. IMO the filesystem is accessed only when needed.

BLOB field should be used in a similar fashion (Access only when needed)

it appear that HTTP exception handler in gluon/main.py:448 is not handling the exception raise in gluon/globals.py:270 correctly. The same property getter keep getting call by multiple exception handlers and the exception eventually fall into mod_wsgi which cause the 500 response.

The best way to do that is to not sort the list, except when displaying and then delete the first entry in the list before inserting the 11th entry.

. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/web2py/crud$20search$20no$20results$20reference$20/web2py/6Q-pBbqxtwE/BP-FcflbgSMJ

Running  2.9.11-stable+timestamp.2014.09.15.23.35.11 on windows, python 2.6.7

This used to work on older versions of web2py and was broken in an upgrade

The bug is in tools.py, class Crud, function get_format

the code calls format = rtable.get('_format', None)

there is no such .get method on a table object (looks like this must have worked on older versions of DAL !?), this causes get_query() to fail, this exception is caught and returns None to crud.Search, the exception is caught and as the comment says '# hmmm, we should do better here', and returns None as the result.

original code:

```
def get_format(self, field):
    rtable = field._db[field.type[10:]]
    format = rtable.get('_format', None)
    if format and isinstance(format, str):
        return format[2:-2]
    return field.name
```

 a fix would be:-

```
def get_format(self, field):
    rtable = field._db[field.type[10:]]
    format = rtable._format or None
    if format and isinstance(format, str):

I started web2py as a local server on 127.0.0.1:8000 on Win7 (using Python 2.7.9 in the case of the checked-out files). An initial application using the wizzard was created (using the release version web2py_win.zip). After that I want to enter some initial datasets into the tables that were just created. I tried to log in on the application front end. I could load the index page, but when trying to access http://127.0.0.1:8000/ProductionDB/default/components_manage (where ProductionDB is the application name and components is a table created via the wizzard), a ticket was created stating:

GoogleDatastoreAdapter  None

After the first test failed using the release version for Windows http://www.web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_win.zip I switched over to the latest GitHub check-out, but got the identical error message. (I recycled the application folder <web2py_base_folder>\applications\ProductionDB from the windows distribution to the GitHub checkout).

In the source code <web2py_base_folder>\gluon\packages\dal\pydal\adapters__init__.py, line 87 the GoogleDatastoreAdapter is set to None if not on a Google AppEngine server (which I am certainly not).

So I guess that there is an issue with the <web2py_base_folder>\gluon\dal.py code that IMHO should not test with isinstance() when there is the possibility to get a TypeError due to an uninitialized second argument.

""This is definitely a bug in the DAL. Probably a very old one that was made evident by the new lockless cache implementation. Passwords should never have been saved in the cache in raw format as the cache is not supposed to be safe for that.  

BaseAdapter does this in the select

```
        (cache_model, time_expire) = cache
        key = self.uri + '/' + sql
        if len(key)>200: key = hashlib_md5(key).hexdigest()

Basically it should always, always, use the hash, not just if the key's len is >200. Please submit an issue this must be fixed ASAP.""

2. Edit a file. In the screenshot I used: http://localhost:8000/admin/default/edit/examples/models/feeds_reader.py?id=models__feeds_reader__py
3. A second scroll bar appears for the page, regardless of the initial size, the page has always the same extra length forcing a page scrollbar, in addition of the editor scrollbar. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? We expect to only have the editor scrollbar. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? I tested on the stable (2.9.12) and git version.
The behavior is the same with Firefox and Chromium. Please provide any additional information below. The problem seems caused by a new ""toolbar"" or footbar that would have been added without adapting the calculation of the height of the page to prevent the scrollbar from appearing. Not sure of the solution, but it might be just a CSS change as well.

782,"dal, column names should be in `quotes`",2015-02-08T19:43:36Z,2015-02-10T07:26:16Z,"bug, imported, Priority-Medium",,,"_From [sin..._at_gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106405431073557545113/) on January 28, 2015 14:07:56_

due to outside restrictions i have tables with column names such as `from` `to` `subject` and so forth,

using restricted words for column names isn't ideal, but it does work when the column name is in `quotes` or the full column name is used db.table.col

the DAL either restricts certain names i.e from.
generates broken SQL statements 

UPDATE templates 
SET 
to = 'abc'
WHERE
    (templates.id = 1);

i am using 

Version 2.7.4-stable+timestamp.2013.11.02.10.08.01

this issue can be easily be fixed, by genrating the quoted version of this statement

i.e

UPDATE `templates` 
SET 
`to` = 'abc'
WHERE
    (`templates`.`id` = 1);

thanks.

This code fail for me if have special characters.

Example:

if:

fail

if:
obj[key] = ""ó""  #string
fail

if change encode for decode in this line work if obj[key] is a unicode.

Is this a possible bug?

{{=SQLTABLE(myRows, headers='labels', truncate=40)}} What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I expect to see the rows in a table with truncated cell values; instead the long string values are displayed in the cells without any truncation.  If I remove the ""headers"" parameter to SQLTABLE then cell truncation works as expected, so somehow the headers value causes the truncate value to be ignored.

I have a weird bug that seems to be triggered when using the multiprocessing module, if web2py is launched from another directory.

I've tried to isolate the issue.  To reproduce the issue, take a clean web2py source tarball, and make the following changes:
1. to the end of applications/welcome/controllers/default.py add the lines:
   import alpha
   def bravo():
       return alpha.charlie()
2. create a new file applications\welcome\modules\alpha.py with the following content
   from multiprocessing import Process, Manager
   
   def delta(output):
       output.append('Hello, world!')
   
   def charlie():
       output = Manager().list()
       p = Process(target=delta, args=(output,))
       p.start()
       p.join()
       return output[0]
3. run it normally, 
       d:\code\temp\web2py>python web2py.py
   ... hit http://127.0.0.1:8000/welcome/default/bravo ... everything works
4. change the current working directory, and relaunch

If it helps, I put a print statement before File ""D:\Python27\lib\multiprocessing\forking.py"", line 489, and it printed out:
        ['d:\code\temp\web2py\web2py']

Something is causing the path to add the directory web2py twice!

If I run the code from one directory above that:
    d:\code\temp>cd ..
    d:\code>python temp\web2py\web2py.py
then the following is printed:
        ['d:\code\temp\web2py\temp\web2py']

Again the path is repeated twice.

Can anyone help me understand what is causing this issue?  What is a potential fix?

If it helps, the real bug got triggered when running web2py behind Apache on Windows (modwsgi), since the wsgi script was launched from some random Apache directory.

separator='' no longer removes the separator from the label, separator=False neither.

I am using web2py 2.9.11 has separator='' been replaced? Please provide any additional information below. Anthony posted yhe following reply:

Looks like a backward incompatible change was made in SQLFORM.**init**. This:

sep = separator or ''

was changed to:

sep = separator or current.response.form_label_separator

That line should instead be:

sep = current.response.form_label_separator if separator is None else separator

Please submit an issue about this. In the meantime, you can do:

- Please provide any additional information below.

The problem is that every time you don't insert any value in the field using a form a null string is validated (i.e. """").
As I can see from code[1] it seams to me the validator expects any kind of value and if it's not a list/tuple it insert into a list and validate it.
Another problem is that if the result of the operation str(item).strip()[2] is evaluated as False no validation is applied... so there's no way to oblige the user not to pass a null value (i.e. to insert any value).

Could it be a solution to remove the mentioned test[2]? Or maybe there's another reason I cannot see not why it is there?

Thank you very mutch

For example in my default.py  
It would be nice and fast if the web IDE have a direct link to each controller.

As coding lines goes up , having to scroll up or down a lot of lines is ""disturbing"". A lot of times i dont know if i have to go up or down.

If there is above the code the ""Exposes"" line to preview each of the controllers, it would also be nice if there was a link to go directly to the line of the controller we want to change.

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Ensure Javascript is enabled.
2. Create a HTML form.
3. Click the 'submit' button. The text of the 'submit' button will change to 'Working...'
4. Have the server return a PDF file (or any other type of file) to the client.
5. Save (or Open) the PDF file.
6. The 'submit' button of the HTML form is now disabled (and will remain disabled until the page is re-loaded). Clicking it again will not re-submit the form. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I expect the 'submit' button to be able to re-submit the HTML form. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? I am running web2py v2.9.5 on Debian Linux 2.6 Please provide any additional information below. This is a very low-priority request.

This is a minor issue and I have figured out a work-around and I doubt many people are affected by this. This 'bug' report is mostly just an FYI.

My use-case is this: I have a HTML form containing some fields. The user may edit the form fields. When the user submits the form, a PDF is generated by the server based on the field values and is returned to the client. The generated PDF may not be correct and the user may wish to change the values of the form. However, the 'submit' button is now disabled. The only way to re-enable it is to re-load the page. Reloading the page wipes out the user's changes.

My work-around was to add a class named 'never-disable' to the 'submit' button of the HTML form and to modify web2py.js.

In web2py.js, I changed this:

```
disableElement: function (el) {
  el.addClass('disabled');
  var method = el.prop('type') == 'submit' ? 'val' : 'html';
```

to this:

```
disableElement: function (el) {
  if ( el.hasClass('never-disable')) { /* added */
    return true;                       /* added */
  }                                    /* added */
  el.addClass('disabled');
  var method = el.prop('type') == 'submit' ? 'val' : 'html';

Environment: Ubuntu 12.04; Web2py 2.9.11-stable

Let me describe the problem as below:
- We use 2 DAL instance talking to 2 different databases, each with a connection pool of 10
- We make many frequent DAL calls using both the DAL connections which results in many objects in the connection pool
- At some point, web2py starts throwing an OperationalError with MySQL server has gone away when closing a connection. The stack trace is as below:

S'Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File “.../app/gluon/main.py"", line 543, in wsgibase\n    BaseAdapter.close_all_instances(\'rollback\')\n  File “.../app/gluon/dal.py"", line 611, in close_all_instances\n    db._adapter.close(action)\n  File “.../app/gluon/dal.py"", line 591, in close\n    getattr(self, action)()\n  File “…/app/gluon/dal.py"", line 1922, in rollback\n    return self.connection.rollback()\nOperationalError: (2006, \'MySQL server has gone away\')\n'

This made the whole app very unstable with error tickets occurring almost for every action. 

We had tried wrapping all our DAL calls with exception handlers for this error but we were unable to get this sorted. Eventually, the only way I could fix this is to put an exception handler around the code block which is throwing the error as below:

# added this to line 611 in dal.py
try:
    db._adapter.close(action)
except:
    pass

Note that, this error is reproducible in older versions of web2py as well.

I would like to bring this forward to the group for further action on the same.

730,request.vars not set by routes_in query string.,2015-01-26T21:10:59Z,2015-12-14T21:31:11Z,"bug, imported, Priority-Medium",,,"_From [iiijjj..._at_gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/103627055288160163786/) on September 26, 2014 16:59:57_

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Define a route in routes_in that sets a query string.
2. Access a page that will be routed.
3. Check the value of request.vars. It is not set.

Here is sample code:

routes.py
    routes_in = (
        (BASE + '/$anything', '/welcome/default/index?aaa=111&bbb=222'),
        ...
        )

Then in applications/welcome/views/default/index.html

```
\<div>
    vars: {{=request.vars}}
    \<br>
    env: {{=request.env.query_string}}
\</div>
```

Then visit the welcome app, request.vars displays empty but request.env.query_string is set to 'aaa=111&bbb=222' What is the expected output? What do you see instead? request.vars should be set to 'aaa=111&bbb=222' What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Tested with: Version 2.9.11-stable+timestamp.2014.09.15.23.35.11

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Login with auth.login(), with bad login info (but valid format to pass validation)
2. Login page will be redisplayed after login failure
3. Email/username field is empty What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The username/email field should retain its values after a failed login.

726,Allow auth.login() to return a specific error message,2015-01-26T21:10:53Z,,"bug, imported, Priority-Medium",,,"_From [markruol..._at_gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/114619454780239522399/) on September 17, 2014 19:29:40_

Currently, auth.login() only returns a generic ""invalid error"" upon login error. 

However, the generic error message is no more secure than an error message detailing whether the password or username/email was incorrect, because the registration page already reveals whether or not a username/email is taken.

Returning a more specific error message upon login error would be a big usability improvement at no cost to security:
1. Is the username/email in the database?
2. Is the password correct for that username/email?

I understand that this is done to be compliant with OWASP, but as discussed here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/0zCjs2G9ucE , it seems it's possible to implement this feature without breaking OWASP compliance.

In a small organization (+- 100 users) it can be dificult to manage ACLs without being able to add group to group membership.

consider my company

we have this groups in the maintenance department

MMC (20 users)
ME ( 15 users)
MI ( 10 users)

MD (maintenance department)
(all users above)

so this group MD is composed of MMC,ME, MI and we dont repeat adding all users to MD, we just add group MMC,ME,MI to MD

When we delete a person from ME, the MD group automaticaly reflects the change.

Also in web2py if i want to block user A to access most of the app, i would need to decorate every function to block user A.

If i could decorate the app itself i would only do it once and would not need to repeat myself for every function that should block user A.

Python Version 2.7.5 Please provide any additional information below. I'm trying to get the scheduler to run alongside the web server.  The OS alerts me that that Python quit unexpectedly and dumps the details to the screen.  The web server will run none-the-less just fine.  It's the worker that never gets started.  I'm not sure what the -X is doing, but I think it has something to do with it.  Main thing that stands out in the OS dump is the following below:
**\* multi-threaded process forked ***
crashed on child side of fork pre-exec
Thread 0 Crashed

Everything works fine if I startup the web server and scheduler separately though.

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. define DAL as follows :

db = DAL('postgres://user:pass__at__localhost/mydb', pool_size=5, check_reserved=['all'], adapter_args={'uploads_in_blob': True})

(Other args like pool_size, check_reserved should not matter, but since that is how I used it, I've listed it here)
1. define a table w/ upload field.
2. Upload a document (use SQLFORM.grid to quickly create an interface)

What is the expected output? 

Documents are stored in DB

What do you see instead?

Documents are stored on the filesystem in uploads folder What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Version 2.9.5-stable+timestamp.2014.03.16.02.35.39
Database drivers available: SQLite(sqlite3), MySQL(pymysql), PostgreSQL(psycopg2), PostgreSQL(pg8000), MongoDB(pymongo), IMAP(imaplib)

on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit Please provide any additional information below. Work around suggested by Anthony on the mailing list (Not yet tested by me) is as follows :

db._adapter.uploads_in_blob = True

Then, when you do:

db.define_table('mytable', Field('myfile', 'upload', uploadfield=True))

you should get a blob field called db.mytable.myfile_blob with the readable and writable attributes set to False.

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. define a Table.with_alias
2. use db(...a query for this table...).update(...something...) What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expected: the SQL generated for the UPDATE transaction uses the _original_ tablename
Actual: the SQL generated for the UPDATE transaction uses the _alias_, and thus runs into an SQL error (relation <alias> does not exist) What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? latest trunk Please provide any additional information below. This uses Query.tables() to determine which table to update, which in turn retrieves the tablenames from the Fields in the query. But when you define a Table.with_alias(), all Fields receive the alias as tablename.

This behavior is absolutely correct for the SELECT case (where it _must_ use the alias), but totally wrong for the UPDATE case (where it _must not_ use the alias).

Of course, it seems nonsense to create a Table.with_alias for an update operation, but the point is that we want to re-use the same Query that we used for a SELECT for a subsequent UPDATE - and that is not at all an edge-case.

Many thanks in advance for fixing this :S

A number of users have reported that the following is no longer working in recent versions of web2py:

from gluon.custom_import import track_changes; track_changes(True)

Apparently even with the above code in a model file, changes in modules are not tracked, so the server must be restarted when changes are made.

When using upload fields with mongodb and SQLFORM (not factory forms) I get the runtime error ""<type 'exceptions.RuntimeError'> you must specify a Field(...,uploadfolder=...)"" the same code but switching to sqlite works correctly. Adding db.table.field.uploadfolder = os.path.join(request.folder,'uploads')  to the controller before processing the form resolves the issue. I believe this might be a bug in the mongodb adapter.

I've got this error, trying to insert with SQLCustomType, with both 2.8.2 and trunk version under Ubuntu 10.04):

```
\<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'> 'str' object has no attribute 'utctimetuple'
```

It fails with SQLFORM, SQLFORM.grid and SQLFORM.smartgrid. It works fine if you replace type=ut_dt with 'datetime'.
- How to reproduce:
1. Code in a controller:

def custom():
    from gluon.dal import SQLCustomType
    from datetime import datetime
    from calendar import timegm

```
ut_dt = SQLCustomType(
    type    = 'datetime',

    encoder = (lambda dt: timegm(dt.utctimetuple())),
    decoder = (lambda ut: datetime.utcfromtimestamp(ut))
)

db = DAL('sqlite:memory:')
db.define_table('event',
    Field('day_and_time', type=ut_dt)
)

form = SQLFORM(db.event)

if form.process().accepted:
    db.event.insert(day_and_time=form.vars.day_and_time)

# To enable this route file you must do the steps:
#
#1. rename <web2py-root-dir>/router.example.py to routes.py

#3. restart web2py (or reload routes in web2py admin interfase)
#
# YOU CAN COPY THIS FILE TO ANY APPLICATION'S ROOT DIRECTORY WITHOUT CHANGES! What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The first line, ""rename <web2py-root-dir>/router.example.py to routes.py
"", is wrong because there is no router.example.py under the web2py root directory.

Instead there are the following files:
<web2py-root-dir>/examples/routes.parametric.example.py
and
<web2py-root-dir>/examples/routes.parametric.example.py

So instructions should reflect that.

Currently, when the update activities launched by the button are complete, a flash message appears (in the default scheme); the button continues to read ""Update""

2) Change the button to ""Restart"" and have it stop the server

3) Display a checklist (tied to the release notes) of things to do between server shutdown and server restart, such as clearing sessions (required with 2.8.1+, due to session format change).

After an automatic Chrome update to 30.0.1599.101 and update to macos Maverick ( don't know if they were the real cause) I couldn't login in admin ( and probably not in the apps) using Chrome. Admin rejected wrong passwords as usual but didn't redirect after entering right password. Other browsers had no problems, Chrome Incognito mode worked too.

I investigated a little using the trunk version and found that web2py stumbled over the content of the current web2py cookie, see below. main.py tried to load the cookie, but generated an error 'invalid key' because of the 'ti:mid' key. This error is ignored (main.py: 435), but after that the cookie is invalid/ incomplete causing a circular redirect to  /admin/default/index?send=&#37;2Fadmin&#37;2Fdefault&#37;2Fsite. Removing the cookie solved the problem. I didn't discover how this cookie got made with this key...

I read a long discussion on maillist Python bugs about Cookie handling  in Python where adding the colon to the accepted characters is discussed, and resolved in python 3.3 but it did not get backported to 2.7 for a good reason: change of functionality.

To illustrate this I made an python fiddle with two suggested solutions.

679,Pagination problem with user-sorted grid,2015-01-26T21:01:04Z,2015-03-21T01:33:25Z,"bug, imported, Priority-Medium",,,"_From [ABasta..._at_gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/103720714265511973715/) on October 11, 2013 03:03:54_

Using SQLFORM.grid (or .smartgrid), once the initial grid has loaded, if the user clicks on a column header to change the sort order, only that single field is used in the SQL ORDER BY clause. However, if the column used for sorting contains non-unique values, pagination may not work correctly, because the order in which the RDBMS returns records is not guaranteed to be the same with each query. For proper pagination, the records should be sorted on one or more columns that generate a single unique ordering.

Note, this problem occurs regardless of what is specified in the ""orderby"" argument to .grid() because the ""orderby"" argument is ignored when the user clicks on a grid header to sort the records.

A possible fix is to add the table ""id"" field to the ORDER BY clause in this case, which will guarantee a unique ordering (and shouldn't add too much processing time given that it is an indexed field). This is already done on the initial grid load if no ""orderby"" argument has been specified (due to the default orderby_on_limitby=True argument of the .select() method).

There is a more general problem with pagination in the grid. If the developer specifies an ""orderby"" argument in order to control the initial ordering of the displayed records, the table ""id"" field is no longer added to the ORDER BY clause, which could result in broken pagination. Since this is unlikely to be the intent in this case, perhaps the grid should always add the ""id"" fields to the ORDER BY. For the rare case where someone might want to prevent that for complete control over the ORDER BY clause, we could add an argument such as auto_pagination=True (set it to False to prevent the automatic behavior).

See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/web2py-developers/nklB1tRh_zU/ZbezJNLs4zgJ for further details.

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Create several tables and at least one user. 
2. Create an 'admin' user group and make the user a member of this group.
3. Add this row to db.py: 

   auth.settings.manager_group_role = 'admin'

...to assign admin privileges to the users belonging to this group.
4. Add a link to the administrator interface somewhere in your app:

   {{=A('Admin...',_href=URL('appadmin','manage',args=['auth']))}}
5. Launch your app and click the 'Admin...'-link. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Initially everything is alright, all tables are visible and rows can be added.
As soon as a row is added to a table this table-content will not be visible, but instead the last table in the ""link column"" will be visible.

Correcting the password in the connection string makes the error go away. 

Although the error might be technically correct (wrong credentials will prevent access to tables) it is not helpful in fixing a configuration error.

- The migration in this case creates a new field, sets it's attributes, then copies the data to it. So it ""temporarily"" needs a default='' for this to work. It copies the entire column to a new-one, in which-case it ""temporarily"" has Nulls, then tries to set the attribute, and THEN copies the data...
  It may be an implementation-detail in psycopg2, but instead of letting it to try to copy the column and trip-on-itself in the process, an ALTER TABLE in the DAL would circumvent this issue... Would be much faster also...

653,notnull constraint not set on foreign key,2015-01-26T20:23:25Z,,"bug, DAL, imported, Priority-Medium",,,"_From [mrauch05@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/mrauch05@gmail.com/) on March 18, 2013 12:06:17_

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. create two tables, add a field to reference the other table and set notnull=True. e.g.
db.define_table('mytable',  
    Field('name', 'string'))

db.define_table('mytable2',  
    Field('name', 'string'),
    Field('mytable', db.mytable, notnull=True)) What is the expected output? What do you see instead? the not null constraint is missing in the created db table:
CREATE TABLE mytable2
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  ""name"" character varying(512),
  mytable integer,
  CONSTRAINT mytable2_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT mytable2_mytable_fkey FOREIGN KEY (mytable)
      REFERENCES mytable (id) MATCH SIMPLE
      ON UPDATE NO ACTION ON DELETE CASCADE
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);
ALTER TABLE mytable2 OWNER TO postgres;

instead it should be
mytable integer NOT NULL,
for the mytable column. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? web2py 2.4.4, Windows 7, Postgres 9.0

Here is the error I get:

Exception IntegrityError: insert or update on table ""auth_membership"" violates foreign key constraint ""auth_membership_user_id_fkey"" DETAIL: Key (user_id)=(3) is not present in table ""auth_user"".

I've tried to migrate from SqlLite to Postgresql using the export_from_csv_file and import_from_csv_file.

Backup went apparently fine; restore is more problematic.

To be complete, I must say I have truncated the postgresql tables first, before importing.

Have I done something wrong?

Here is the begining of the csv file:

1. I have two tables in my application:
   status_tbl:
   Fields:
   serial_no,
   event,
   updated_on,
   interval_time

device_config:
device_name,
owner_email_id,
serial_no
1. I have to display the grid view of status_tbl so when I display the grid of this table and checked the drop-down options of query field, it displays id,serial_no,event,updated_on and interval_time.

I want to display device_name and owner_email_id as well in option drop-down, so drop-down menu should display id,serial_no,event,updated_on,interval_time,device_name and owner_email_id.

Issues:
1. How to make it possible to display fields of other table in grid view of another table and upon selecting of extra fields , user should be able to execute the query(search, clear etc...)?
2. Please provide me the solution of displaying and hiding these extra fields on the grid means I may display some of these extra fields to the grid and some of not but query should work even those extra fields not displayed on the grid.

I am using web2py2.1.1 version on windows XP machine, but fix should work on other OS also.

I am flexible to move to latest version of web2py version so please provide me the solution of it and the version of web2py on which it will be fixed so i will migrate to that version.

web2admin is a good start to a better data admin for web2py, It puts web2py closer to Django in terms of admin interface, filters, etc.

With the power of grid customization it would be a nice addition.

I am asking to consider the inclusion of web2admin (experimental for a while) as replacement for appadmin or as a supported option, but fully reviewed and integrated, maybe modified and with total support of web2py project.

from gluon.tools import Auth
auth = Auth(db, hmac_key=Auth.get_or_create_key())

if db(db.x.id > 0).count() == 0:
    db.x.insert(name='test') 
1. In the controller have:

def index2():
    return dict(grid=SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.x)) 
1. In view index2.html have:
   {{extend 'layout.html'}}
   {{=grid}}
2. Visit index.html in your browser.
3. Visit index2.html
4. observe that the y and z references are not in the x grid
5. Set lazy_tables=False, visit index2.html notice visit index2.html again, see that y and z references are now present in the grid. Setting lazy_tables=True will make them disappear again.

*\* What is the expected output? What do you see instead? **

The y and z references should always appear in the smartgrid.

*\* What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? **

web2py 2.0.9, Windows 7, postgresql 9.2

626,Querying on 1:M Relationships in Grid  and Smartgrid,2015-01-26T20:16:36Z,2015-10-13T20:06:42Z,"enhancement, imported, Priority-Medium",,,"_From [mike.leo...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/109626380233121956961/) on September 05, 2012 22:07:38_

Hello,

We're building a web2py application that leverages SQLFORM.smartgrid heavily.  Out of the box, this does not support filtering on 1:M relationships, or reference fields on the model. We understand the concerns about this: It could potentially be a huge performance hit, especially if the related table has a large number of rows.

On the other hand, this functionality is very valuable. Being able to filter on related tables is a very common need in applications.  Often, users need to filter on ""lookup"" tables that have a relatively small number of rows, and the performance hit is negligible. This is a very common feature in Django, and in Rails admin interfaces like ActiveScaffold and RailsAdmin.

Example:

Given a model like this:

db.define_table('book',
    Field('user_id', 'reference auth_user'),
    Field('title'),
    Field('genre'))

And a controller like this:

def index():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.book)
    return dict(grid=grid)

The query interface will look like this by default: http://i49.tinypic.com/2ugjt02.jpg Note how this includes title and genre, but not the auth_user reference.

We patched web2py to allow to for 1:M reference fields in the query interface. The resulting interface and generated query look something like this: http://i46.tinypic.com/28taq74.png Here is our simple patch to allow searching on reference fields like this (web2py version 1.99.7): https://gist.github.com/ff543a5c6d3bc14b9079 This is obviously NOT ready for production; it's a simple proof of concept.  Note the potentially very expensive ""ALL"" query. Because of the performance risks, something like this only makes sense if developers can opt in, i.e. explicitly say so if they want to include a given reference field in the query interface.
1. Would the web2py maintiners be interested in a feature like this if it is opt-in?  I'm willing to devote some time to submit a more robust patch if I could get some guidance.
2. I also have a simple implementation for querying on list:reference fields that I can share as well.

Finally, I just want to thank the web2py team. I've really enjoyed using the framework and hope to help out as much as I can.

Thanks,

Problem:
I'm building mobile apps using PhoneGap, whose frontend cannot be generated server-side using web2py views (templates).

Solution:
Build the frontend using JavaScript with JSONRPC calls to the web2py server. Control authentication using the RFCified Digest Access Authentication.

Example (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication ):

• The client asks for a page that requires authentication but does not provide a username and password. Typically this is because the user simply entered the address or followed a link to the page.
• The server responds with the 401 ""client-error"" response code, providing the authentication realm and a randomly-generated, single-use value called a nonce.
• At this point, the browser will present the authentication realm (typically a description of the computer or system being accessed) to the user and prompt for a username and password. The user may decide to cancel at this point.
• Once a username and password have been supplied, the client re-sends the same request but adds an authentication header that includes the response code.
• In this example, the server accepts the authentication and the page is returned. If the username is invalid and/or the password is incorrect, the server might return the ""401"" response code and the client would prompt the user again.

620,Clarify the implications of reloading routes and/or using symlinks in the applications folder.,2015-01-26T20:14:25Z,2015-09-21T20:49:57Z,"enhancement, imported, Priority-Medium",,,"_From [douglas....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110212829783450100486/) on June 11, 2012 05:57:55_

I've spent far too much time trying to figure out if it is safe to use symlinks in the application folder.
What I've learned is that they are OK so long as they don't change while the server is running.
Similarly, reloading routes may cause problems on an active server.

Propose the following changes to The Book:

In http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/4 In the section that talks about 'track changes', it seems to imply that all modules would be reloaded if changed. I assume from the language there that would include routes.py - I think that should be mentioned there as a concern to turning on track_changes on a production server if routes.py might be modified.

In the section that talks about Application init:
'Make a symbolic link from ""applications/init"" to your application's folder.'
Add: (Note: changing where the symbolic links points while web2py is running is not supported and could cause hard to find errors.)
or words to that effect

In the section on URL rewrite, where it says:
Notice that if you edit routes.py, you must reload it. This can be done in two ways: by restarting the web server or by clicking on the routes reload button in admin. If there is a bug in routes, they will not reload.
Add: (Note: reloading routes while web2py is running is not supported and could cause hard to find errors. Note also that setting track_changes can result in routes being reloaded whenever the routes file is changed, and this is also not supported)

I ran into a problem of my own creation when playing with an application that I generated using the admin application-creating wizard, which is how I stumbled onto this.

The appwizard creates a db.py for defining the auth_user table based on the web interaction, but it does so using a full-specified auth_user table definition instead of using the extra_fields capability.

It's probably just a matter of keeping all the moving parts in sync, but I wanted to create this issue so it doesn't get forgotten about.

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Create a table with a datetime field, and populate it with correct datetime data using the database administration console. I have called my table call below.
2. Create a smartquery REST interface. Something like:

@request.restful()
#@auth.requires_login()
def calldatasmart():
    response.view = 'generic.'+request.extension
    def GET(search):
        try:
            rows = db.smart_query([db.call],search).select()
            return dict(result=rows)
        except RuntimeError:
            raise HTTP(400,""Invalid search string"") 
    return locals()
1. In web2py on SQLlite you can call the REST interface with just a date query and it will work:
   If I put in: 

http://localhost:8000/api/calldatasmart.json?search=call.start is greater than ""2010-03-14""
I get a valid response.

In web2py on GAE, (and populate data in table call as above) when calling the same REST interface with just a date query, I get an error, however with a datetime query I get an error:

http://localhost:8000/api/calldatasmart.json?search=call.start is greater than ""2010-03-14""
Errors with 

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '' in version 1.99.7 and also in modified Trunk.

http://localhost:8080/api/calldatasmart.json?search=call.start is greater than ""2010-03-14 20:58:54""
IT WORKS PERFECTLY, at least in the TRUNK - note have not tried this in 1.99.7 yet (however I hope it works) What is the expected output? What do you see instead? In GAE when I smartquery using a date only, I expect GAE and SQLLite to work the same. i.e. that it either returns a Null set or a valid row from the table. Similarly the query with datetime should work. Note I now know that a datetime request will work it seems so I can go forward as can others. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? I tested this in 1.99.7 and also in the Trunk from as of at 18th April 2012. Please provide any additional information below. Massimo requested I create this bug, although as I said the workaround is fine for GAE, although it is not consistent that the call works in SQLLite and not in GAE.

Massimo asked me to make this ticket for him.

I wrote a Chrome extension that watches connections to localhost for web2py error pages. When it finds such a page, it creates an iframe and loads the ticket in the iframe. Saves me time and trouble during development. Massimo is going to add a link to the docs.

web2py has maintained excellent backwards compatibility so far. However, sometimes, behavior SHOULD be changed. e.g., the response.generic_patterns default was changed because of a security problem, and this caused applications to break.

Suggested solution: add a call

web2py_configuration(version, ...) to the application's **init**.py file which states the assumptions of this version, e.g.

web2py_configuration(version=(1,99,4))

or alternatively a to a new CONFIG file int he web2py/applications/appname directory.

If there has been a breaking change, web2py could revert to old behavior and give a warning, or abort if there is no possible way to do that (or undesirable to do that).

e.g.

```
if global.web2py_configuration.version \< (1,94.1):
    warn(""Generic responses introduce a vulnerability. Please upgrade your app, notes at: http://web2py.com/upgrade-through-1-94-1"" )
    if global.web2py_configuration.if_vulnerable == 'Do not abort, I know what I am doing and take full responsibility':  response.generic_patterns = ['*']
    else: raise Exception('Need changes, see warnings')
```

(an example that would let the user ignore vulnerabilities by an elaborate setting; might not be a good idea).

Now, make the wizard insert the current version number in the **init**.py or CONFIG file; Refuse running if there is no version information (or alternatively, warn about it and assume 1.99.7). Make the user edit the file manually (or through the app admin) when they have done the upgrade.

Breaking changes I would _like_ to see:
- default sqlite setting to ""pragma foreign_keys=1;"" to enforce foreign key constraints. (I set it in my apps, but I think it should be default)
- default ondelete_action changed to 'RESTRICT' (or at least selectable). I personally set it to restrict always, because on a cross-linked database model, it is easy to accidentally cascade-delete millions of records when you are only trying to delete one.
- default for migration is off. migration can be enabled like today by changing the migrate=... flag, or through the admin app (in which case it turns off automatically after a transaction with a successful migration has occured)
- experimental features need to be turned on explicitly (e.g. a ""require_experimental=['feature1', 'feature2', ...] in web2py_configuration)
- optionally switching db query result set from list() to generator/iterator.

You might not agree with about these changes, but putting infrastructure for future-proofing is a good idea regardless of the specific breaking changes.

If the tables have circular or mutual references, there is no order in which everything will work. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? all Please provide any additional information below. The problem is that sqlhtml_validators() is applied at t1 definition time, when t2 does not exist yet (and therefore the format cannot be made to represent). My temporary solution: after all tables are defined, I fix representations with the following function:

```
from gluon.dal import sqlhtml_validators
def dalfix(tables, fields):
    for t in tables:
        for f in fields:
            t[f].requires = sqlhtml_validators(t[f])
```

And in this case, the fixing call would be:

```
dalfix([db.t1], ['a'])
```

(I use lists because in the real app I have multiple tables and multiple repeating fields to fix)

Purpose of code changes on this branch: There are times that some pages of our app will be loaded inside an iframe (rather than in the main page via LOAD(..., ""foo.load"", ajax=True)). In this situation we will hope the loaded page displays no header, footer, topbar.

Instead of maintaining two independent copies of full-stuff page and contents-only page, I come up with a trick to let one same page have different appearances, controlled by different url parameters.

The normal, full-stuff page: http://my_site/app/cont/action

The contents-only page: http://my_site/app/cont/action#_css_injection_begin_ .header, .footer, .topbar, #header, #footer, #statusbar {display:none} _css_injection_end_

This feature is achieved by following code at the end of generic.html (or layout.html if you prefer):

<script><!-- Dynamic css injection. Called by url?..._css_injection_begin_.header,.footer,.topbar{display:none}_css_injection_end_ to hide those components. -->
var matched = new RegExp('_css_injection_begin_(.+)_css_injection_end_').exec(location.href);
if(matched){
    document.write(""<style>""+unescape(matched[1])+""</style>"");//Python escapes comma and colon, decodeURL() does not unescape them back, but unescape() does.

On what operating system? Any Please provide any additional information below. Simple sidestep: make the inherited field have ""requires=[]"" to disable automatic requires computation (and it can be added manually if it is needed)

In the database, uniqueness is enforced with respect to 'b', but in web2py in respect to 'a'; web2py should either not try to enforce this, or try to enforce this with respect to 'b'.

This is easy to do for non-db tables -- just keep the requires at DEFAULT until the real table is instantiated (and let _that_ compute requires).

With non-db tables, it's not as simple; not sure how to solve it.

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. See the first example here: http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/7#SQLFORM.factory 2. it doesn't mention that the uploadfolder argument is required
3. If you pass garbage or a string that doesn't point to a folder, the file is not uploaded and saved.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?  I feel that uploadfolder should NOT be required, as the example would imply.  But, if it is determined that uploadfolder is necessary then it should validate the folder that is passed and raise an exception if for some reason it cannot save the file there.  

Instead, I'm seeing that I can pass gibberish to the argument and the file is then not saved. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Trunk, updated around 8:30 central on 1/3/2012. Please provide any additional information below. In my opinion the uploadfolder arg should be optional.  In my situation, I'm processing the uploaded file (reading through a csv) and do not want it stored on the server, my code handles the processing and saving.  

Also, there should be some way to define an application-wide default.

If the uploadfolder arg is passed, then it needs to be validated to ensure that we can store a file there.  If the file is not successfully stored to the specified server location, and exception should be raised.

There are situations where one wants to specify an upload file, but does not want it to be automatically stored on the server.  Therefore, maybe another parm should be available to tell web2py not to save it after it is processed.

604,datetime precision is silently truncated by web2py,2015-01-26T20:10:28Z,2015-12-29T19:37:29Z,"bug, imported, Priority-Medium",,,"_From [i.like.p...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110204180798759823131/) on December 01, 2011 00:40:38_

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. create a table with a datetime column
2. insert a datetime value that has fractional seconds, e.g. value=datetime.datetime(2011,11,30,10,20,30,345678) or most likely value=datetime.datetime.now(), using table.insert(datetimecol=value)
3. check database directly, and you'll see that the fractions are missing.
4. insert using string notation table.insert(datetimecol=value.isoformat())
5. check database directly, and you'll see that the values _are_ in database
6. load the database row back 'print table[1].datetimecol' and see that the fractions are gone
7. export datetime value as csv and json, and observe that the fractions are silently truncated as well. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expected output is: when using a datetime value with fractional seconds, either the insert fails or the fractional seconds get to the database. When selecting, if the database has fractional seconds, I expect them to be retrieved and not silently truncated.
Similarly, I expect csv export followed by truncate followed by import to return a table to its existing state, without silently truncating values. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? 1.99.2 (but it's been this way since at least 1.95), on Ubuntu 10.04 and on Win7 Please provide any additional information below. Not all databases support fractional seconds in datetime: sqlite, postgres do; oracle, mysql, db2 don't. 

Specifically on sqlite, if you force sqlite to do the string->datetime translation (by passing driver_args={'detect_types': sqlite3.PARSE_DECLTYPES}), and you always insert the values as string, then you actually get fractional seconds. But you're still getting truncated in csv and json exports, perhaps also xml.

Suggested solution:
1. refactor datetime<->text and text<->datetime conversions; these are currently repeated in
   serializers.py once (json serialization), tools.py once (csv output), dal.py (base represent(), oracle/informix/db2 represent_exceptions(), Rows as_dict(), Rows export_to_csv_file none_exception; parsing repeated in parse() and GoogleSQL code); and make them hookable so that an app can request higher precision handling if needed; also mark in adapter that this resolution is NOT AVAILABLE on Oracle, MySQL, etc. and trigger error if time has second fractions.
2. Just add a warning/error in all the places where second fractions are silently dropped

I would much prefer option (1), but (2) is the lesser of two evils.

If I submit a patch that does (1), will it be accepted? if not, will you accept a patch that does (2)?

537,Add option of using offical ibm_db_dbi driver instead of ODBC driver for DB2 ,2014-10-24T19:28:49Z,2014-10-24T22:27:57Z,,,,"In order to take advantage of this driver, you will also have to install the IBM Data Server Driver Package and configure a DSN in etiher the db2cli.ini or the db2dsdriver.cfg files. 

And example db2dsdriver.cfg file would look like this:

```
<configuration>
   <dsncollection>
      <dsn alias=""DB2"" name=""database_name"" host=""database.host.FQDN"" port=""50000""/>
   </dsncollection>
</configuration>
```

After setting up the Data Server Driver Package and a DSN, you need to export the IBM_DB_HOME envar

```
export IBM_DB_HOME=/install/path/to/dsdriver/
```

Then you can install ibm_db from pypi

```
pip install ibm_db
```

Finally you need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH envar to include the dsdriver/lib folder

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/install/path/to/dsdriver/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

You can now test the driver using Python like this:

```
import ibm_db_dbi
conn = ibm_db_dbi.connect('DB2', 'db2_user', 'db2_pass') #DB2 is the value of alias in db2dsdriver.cfg
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute(""SELECT current date FROM sysibm.sysdummy1"")
cur.fetchone() 
```

The corresponding new connection string in web2py looks like this: 

```
'db2:ibm_db_dbi://DSN=dsn;UID=user;PWD=pass'
```

And the updated one for ODBC connections:

```
'db2:pyodbc://driver=DB2;hostname=host;database=database;uid=user;pwd=password;port=port'    
```

Similar changes could be made for the Informix adapter since the ibm_db_db/ibm_db_dbi driver supports it however I do not have the resources to test that database.

According to the MySQL 5.5 manual [1], comma-separated table references in joins
should be wrapped in parenthesis or JOIN should be used instead of comma.

Further explanation from the manual: The ON clause takes precedence since
a couple of versions so the operands for the ON clause change:

SELECT \* FROM t1, t2 JOIN t3 ON (t1.i1 = t3.i3);

The operands for the ON are t2 and t3. t1.i1 is not known at this point.

                Field('chromosome_id', 'integer'),

Due to those several calls the value of el.data('w2p:enable-with') is initially and correctly set to the value of the element but then is re-set to 'working ...' because this latter is the value of the element.

316,Fix list types in GAE NDB after entity write,2013-12-02T21:30:49Z,2013-12-03T03:41:26Z,,,,"As per
http://code.google.com/p/appengine-ndb-experiment/issues/detail?id=208
(""List items from repeated StringProperty get mutated to _BaseValue on
put"") it seems to be expected behavior that lists in NDB models get
mutated to _BaseValue lists after .put() is called.

In web2py this corresponds to:

```
db.define_table('listintegertest',
    Field('dummy', 'boolean'),
    Field('integerlist', 'list:integer'),
    Field('stringlist', 'list:string'),
)

iidee = db.listintegertest.insert(
    integerlist=[1,2,3,4],
    stringlist=[""1"",""2"",""3"",""4""]
)
row = db.listintegertest(iidee)
db.listintegertest[row.id] = dict(dummy=True)

print ""type is %s"" % (type(row.integerlist[0]))
print ""type is %s"" % (type(row.stringlist[0]))
```

The output of the above is currently:

```
type is <class 'google.appengine.ext.ndb.model._BaseValue'>
type is <class 'google.appengine.ext.ndb.model._BaseValue'>
```

while this is expected:

```
type is <type 'int'>
type is <type 'unicode'>
```

The workaround is to copy the list from the NDB model instead of
relying on it not being changed afterwards.

list:reference is not affected since parse_list_references() already
recreates the list in NoSQLAdapter case.

315,Use translitcodec for urlify,2013-12-02T21:04:15Z,2014-03-02T23:24:07Z,,,,"[`urlify`](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/231fa489cbe35408dba0ee41253750a065fa1fff/gluon/validators.py#L2505) does its job and does it well.

not) constructor is passed the referenced table name as the first
parameter.

For non-NDB, the first parameter is 'verbose_name'. For NDB, the first
parameter is 'name'.

In NDB mode this causes the property to have a wrong identity and
therefore references fail to work properly.

The verbose_name set in non-NDB mode is relatively harmless in
comparison, but seems to be wrong as well as it does not really make
sense.

Do not pass referenced table name to the IntegerProperty constructor in
either case.

The st_astext() converts the binary content of the database in a more readable form. However, the st_astext is not the only function we can use to convert the binary content (es in postgis we can use st_asewkt).
My view is to fix the issue with this PR, and review the whole code in a future release ex: by removing the explicit call to .st_astext, user can still add the .st_astext when needed.

254,Improvements for number range validators,2013-10-12T20:20:07Z,2013-10-13T13:26:27Z,,,,"First commit is fixes, especially that 0 wasn't accepted, for example `IS_INT_IN_RANGE(-5,5)(0)` misbehaved.

Second commit is for consistency. `IS_INT_IN_RANGE(None,None,'')('foo')` misbehaved because unlike the other eleven cases, `error_message` wasn't compared against None. And the word `decimal` was inconsistent with the other seven decimal/float cases, especially the corresponding None/None case of the float range validator.

Third commit is a rewrite of the three number range validator constructors. I found especially the old integer one very complicated, confusing and repetitive. Unless my thinking and tests failed, this should be a pure code rewrite, no change in behavior. My first two commits prepared for this.

Doctests and unittests look good, and I additionally ran a lot of tests with which I found the errors/inconsistencies fixed by my first two commits. My additional tests compared attributes and validation results of the validators before and after my third commit. They find no differences. Here's the code, in case you'd like to see:

```

error_messages = ['foo', None, '']
values = [-11, -10, -9, -1, 0, 1, 9, 10, 11, '+2', 'bar', None, '', '0xF', '3.14', 3.14, '3.0', 3.0, 10**99, -10**99]

            print(""differ:\n  {}\n  has '{}'\n  {}\n  doesn't"".format(
                  b, attr, a))

print('start comparing')
for vali_new, vali_cur in vali_pairs:
    print(""  comparing {}"".format(vali_new))
    for min in mins:

                v_cur = vali_cur(min, max, error_message)
                compare_attributes(v_new, v_cur)

                    if v_new(value) != v_cur(value):
                        print(min, max, error_message, value, v_new(value), v_cur(value))

153,call to build_parsemap() on __init__ instead of at every select(),2013-07-31T22:12:07Z,2013-08-01T06:59:42Z,,,,"hard to give a consistent figure, but for ~10 select()s the speedup is ~3%. Speedup grows with the number of select()s for every request (if DAL is used within a web env) or for every select() done in a single connection (e.g. in a script). 

There's a small performance penalty only if the application has a DAL connection but the controller doesn't need any select(). Anyway, given that in that case the time to build one-time the parsemap dict is the same one saved for each and every select() operation, I think that this behaviour (calling on **init**) is better than calling it in parse() for the majority of the applications. 

This commit limits users fiddling with the undocumented build_parsemap() function, because it's not possible to specify a custom parsemap after connecting to a database. Given that such users are pretty advanced, they can circumvent the limit overriding the adapter with a custom build_parsemap().

our interface to support a bulk deleting method so as to reduce the number of
requests needed to be made.

As part of our miration path of getting our app to speak JSON from end-to-end,
we also wanted to ensure it was able to take a message body similar to a web
form submission.

e.g.
[form data]

71,Adds IS_IPADDRESS() to gluon/validators.py,2013-04-05T16:22:35Z,2013-04-08T02:41:25Z,,,,"IS_IPADDRESS() is mostly a meta function that will call IS_IPV4()
or IS_IPV6 accordingly based upon both dev-configured logic and
library checking of the address given. For instance:

```
 >>> IS_IPADDRESS()('192.168.1.5')
 ('192.168.1.5', None)
```

will run through the IS_IPV4() function since the ipaddr.py lib
recognizes it as an IPv4 address. Specific v4 or v6 validation
can be done by setting is_ipv4=True or is_ipv6=True:

```
 >>> IS_IPADDRESS(is_ipv4=True)('fe80::126c:8ffa:fe22:b3af')
 ('fe80::126c:8ffa:fe22:b3af', 'enter valid IP address')
 >>> IS_IPADDRESS(is_ipv6=True)('192.168.1.1')
 ('192.168.1.1', 'enter valid IP address')
```

The same arguments for IS_IPV4() and IS_IPV6() are supported and
no changes have been made to either of these two functions. The
goal of this function is to allow IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in a
textfield:

```
 INPUT(_type='text', _name='name', requires=IS_IPADDRESS())

required=

(default: True)

to the IS_IN_DB validator.   If set to False, then the validator return value None (and no error) in case no value has been selected. 

Rationale:

Some fields in databases are not required.  Thus, it makes sense to have an option so that the IS_IN_DB validator checks that either the value is in the specified DB set (as now), _or_, the selection has been left empty. 

For instance, assume that I have a field as follows:

Field('teaching_assistant', db.person),

The database accepts a None value (because db....teaching_assistant.required has not been set to True).  So if I have a set of possible TAs q (as defined by a query), and I want the teaching assistant to be either selected from q, or left blank, I can now use:

IS_IN_DB(q, required=False)

The web2py.py command-line script (and related files) and the Tk widget have been updated to make use of IPv6.

Some related code has been refactored.

Several bugs have been squished (and hopefully none introduced).

Some documentation errors have been corrected and some documentation has been added (--help and in the source).

If everything checks out okay, I'll update the book and send a pull request soon.

Try it out:

35,Optimized script for nginx and uwsgi on ubuntu 12.04,2012-09-22T14:10:33Z,2012-09-24T17:44:49Z,,,,"I installed this script on several machines and after a month of testing I figured out the basic configuration for a performatic uwsgi.

Without this settings uwsgi can be a memory eater. (see the thread about wsgi by Bruce Wade on the list, this script was based on Bruce tips)

Explanations:
1. Use unix socket instead of tcp
2. set the app to start the **master** process - it is useful for monitoring with uwsgitop and also for **no-orphans**
3. set the **processes** to 4 (but this depends on the installed machine, for web2py 4 is the minimum)
4. **harakiri** 60 - Every request that will take longer than the seconds specified in the harakiri timeout will be dropped and the corresponding worker recycled.
5. set the maximum amount of seconds to wait for a worker death during a graceful reload
6. **cpu-affinity** - http://lists.unbit.it/pipermail/uwsgi/2011-March/001594.html
7. **Stats** - output the stats on tmp so you can use $uwsgitop /tmp/stats.socket to monitoring the workers
## THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR WEB2PY
1. **reload-mercy** - set the maximum amount of seconds to wait for a worker death during a graceful reload
2. **limit-as** limit the address space usage of each uWSGI process using POSIX/UNIX setrlimit()
3. **max-requests** 2000 - set the maximum number of requests for each worker. When a worker reaches this number it will get recycled. You can use this option to dumb fight memory leaks (even if reload-on-as and reload-on-rss are more useful for this kind of problem)
4.  **reload-on-as** recycle a workers when its address space usage is over the limit specified
5. **reload-on-rss** Works as reload-on-as but it control the physical unshared memory. You can enable both
6. **no-orphans** automatically kill workers without a master process
7. **vacuum** - automatically remove unix socket and pidfiles on server exit

I did a lot of tests and on a Linode 1024 machine with Ubuntu 12.04 that is the best setup. 
If running a Linode 2048 (or any machine with 2GB RAM)  the config can be doubled to:

**max-requests** - 4000, **reload-on-as** 512, **reload-on-rss** 192, **limit-as** 1024 , **processes** 8, **cpu-affinity** 3

It is important: http://lists.unbit.it/pipermail/uwsgi/2011-March/001594.html

Also on nginx.conf it is usefull to set the number of processes/workers - I am using 12

``` javascript
user www-data;
worker_processes 12;
pid /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections 768;
    # multi_accept on;
}

http {
....
}
```

Code

``` xml
<uwsgi>
    <plugin>python</plugin>
    <socket>/run/uwsgi/app/web2py/web2py.socket</socket>
    <pythonpath>/home/www-data/web2py/</pythonpath>
    <app mountpoint=""/"">
        <script>wsgihandler</script>
    </app>
    <master/>
    <processes>4</processes>
    <harakiri>60</harakiri> 
    <reload-mercy>8</reload-mercy>
    <cpu-affinity>1</cpu-affinity>
    <stats>/tmp/stats.socket</stats>
    <max-requests>2000</max-requests>
    <limit-as>512</limit-as>
    <reload-on-as>256</reload-on-as>
    <reload-on-rss>192</reload-on-rss>
    <no-orphans/>
    <vacuum/>    
</uwsgi>
```

and

``` javascript

                uwsgi_pass      unix:///run/uwsgi/app/web2py/web2py.socket;
                include         uwsgi_params;

So if the `Field` constructor is passed `custom_qualifier = 'SOME QUALIFIER'` then that string will be tacked onto `ftype` by `ftype += (' %s' % field.custom_qualifier)` so that the generated SQL for creating the table will have the added qualifier.
