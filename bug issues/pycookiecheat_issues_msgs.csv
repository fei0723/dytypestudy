**my machine version info:** 
Linux version 4.9.43-1-MANJARO (builduser@manjaro) (gcc version 7.1.1 20170630 (GCC) ) #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Aug 13 20:28:47 UTC 2017
**google-chrome version:**
60.0.3112.101 (Official Build) (64-bit)

here's my test code:
```python
import requests
from pycookiecheat import chrome_cookies


if __name__ == '__main__':
      url = 'https://www.google.com'
      cookies = chrome_cookies(url)

hers's traceback:
```

```
And I also research the issue https://github.com/n8henrie/pycookiecheat/issues/12
I was wondering if the value of `my_pass` is wrong, so I print every detail in decrypt process
here's return:
```
encrypted_value:  b'v11\n?r\xec\xcb\x8f\x8f\x1c\x08\x05A 8\xec\x81N~7\xc1O\xa0\xc0\xdd\xbb\xfb\xaa=\xfb\x90\xbd\x1f$'

clean_decrypted_value:  
```
**unlocked_keyring was got from your code**
**clean_decrypted_value is ues clean() function** got.
Some clean_decrypted_value is None, some are runs faild, and got the same log `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xbe in position 0: invalid start byte`.

Please help me figure this out. Thanks!

BTW, forgive my poor English..."

15,Chromium stores keys in different places than Chrome,2017-06-26T16:16:50Z,2017-06-27T21:45:38Z,,,,"I found the Chromium on Ubuntu 16.04 stores keys in the keyring ""Chromium Safe Storage"", not ""Chrome Safe Storage"".  The profile directory is different for Chromium on OSX as well."
14,default password isn't always set,2017-05-28T03:41:23Z,2017-06-13T15:12:11Z,,,,"So I don't store any passwords in chromium and have never set a master password. I don't use gnome-keyring for anything, but it's installed. pycookiecheat fails because no ""my_pass"" key gets set in the config dict. The default key only gets set if this try block fails:

    try:
        import gi
        gi.require_version('Secret', '1')
        from gi.repository import Secret
    except ImportError:
        config['my_pass'] = 'peanuts'

In my case, the try block executes fine. However, there just isn't any ""Chrome Safe Storage"" in the keyring. In fact, there seems to be nothing in it (the outer loop iterates over one item, but there are no items for the inner loop to iterate in my case):

    else:
        flags = Secret.ServiceFlags.LOAD_COLLECTIONS
        service = Secret.Service.get_sync(flags)

        gnome_keyring = service.get_collections()
        unlocked_keyrings = service.unlock_sync(gnome_keyring).unlocked

        for unlocked_keyring in unlocked_keyrings:
            for item in unlocked_keyring.get_items():
                if item.get_label() == ""Chrome Safe Storage"":
                    item.load_secret_sync()
                    config['my_pass'] = item.get_secret().get_text()
                    break
            else:
                # Inner loop didn't `break`, keep looking
                continue

            # Inner loop did `break`, so `break` outer loop
            break

I tried the following and now everything works great:

    def get_linux_config() -> dict:
        config = dict()  # type: Dict[str, Any]
        config.update({
            'my_pass': 'peanuts',
            'iterations': 1,
            'cookie_file': '~/.config/chromium/Default/Cookies',
            })
        return config

So the problem seems to be that the default password is not set by... default.

Thanks for your script!"

7,Correctly match all domains and wildcard domains,2015-07-14T02:13:48Z,2015-07-19T22:31:22Z,,,,"I was not able to log into a web site because it created cookies beneath the `example.com` level, putting several of them instead down at the `foo.example.com` level for the particular service it was trying to access. Furthermore, some of them were specified using the wildcard `.foo.example.com` so that they would be delivered to subdomains of `foo` as well — but a leading `.` was not previously allowed by this library, meaning that these cookies were left out of my requests.

This patch descends through the possible domain name matches in the same order that a browser should, and allows my Python script to successfully authenticate to the service that I was previously locked out of!

Also, this tweaks the code to avoid a possible encoding problem with hand-quoted domain names that include special characters — by relying on the sqlite3 ""?"" quoting character to get the quoting correct.
