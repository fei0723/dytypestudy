1301,Connections kept forever in connection pool,2017-12-21T13:59:33Z,,,,,"Maybe this is intended as otherwise it would add complexity to the connection pool but connections are never removed from the pool, so long lived apps with a burst of requests will keep those connection objects in memory forever.
The solution could be adding a stale timeout parameter to the connection pool and removing the connections from the pool after that timeout."
1300,urllib3 wrong computation of 'Content-Length' for file upload,2017-12-20T19:58:49Z,,,,,"Hi! This is my first posting ever on this site. I hope to have come to the right place. 

System: Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3.5.

I need to upload a simple text file to Internet servers. With ""curl"" the operation goes smoothly, both with http and https protocols, both up/downloads. With urllib3 and other TCP-IP handlers (e.g., requests)  file downloads work correctly, also when authentication is necessary. Uploads, however, do not work.

A log verification with TCPDUMP indicates that with urllib3 (requests, etc.) the generated header for 'Content-Length' contains a wrong file length indication. The file is not uploaded, the servers return different error messages. 

code example
```python
headers = {'authorization': 'Basic ==codeduserpwd=='}
resp = http_client.request('PUT',
                           'https://webserver.com',
                           headers=headers,
                           fields={'filewhat': (filename, filename.open())}
                           )
```
Header log for urllib3 (does not work)
```
	PUT /remote.php/dav/files/gpiani/ HTTP/1.1
	Host: www.hosthere.com
	Accept-Encoding: identity
	Content-Length: 281
	Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=b20a0...
	authorization:  Basic ==codeduserpwd==
```
Header log for curl (it works)
```
        PUT /remote.php/dav/files/gpiani/MYFILE HTTP/1.1
        Host: www.hosthere.com
        Authorization: Basic  ==codeduserpwd==
        User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
        Accept: */*
        Content-Length: 94
```
The two major differences are the file indication in the header and of course the content length. Concerning the first aspect I can take that in consideration while passing the destination file name, but without the correct file length the whole procedure does not work.

If anything needs to be tested I am of course fully interested to do it.

Thankful for your support!"
1299,Don't send IP address as SNI.,2017-12-20T07:35:08Z,2017-12-20T11:09:53Z,,,,"In RFC-6066 section-3, it was said that SNI is for host name not for IP

1298,IP shouldn't be set as SNI,2017-12-20T07:01:02Z,,,,,"## Summary
According to RFC 6066, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#section-3,
Literal IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are not permitted in ""HostName"".

However, when I send requests like resp = s.get('https://192.168.1.140', verify=False), requests will put 192.168.1.140 in SNI.

## How to reproduce
* Use tcpdump to collect network packets. `sudo tcpdump -X -S -s 0 -i eth0 -w wireshark.log`
* Run below script:
```python
import certifi
import urllib3
ip = '140.211.11.105'
http = urllib3.PoolManager(cert_reqs = 'CERT_NONE', ca_certs = certifi.where())
r = http.request('GET', 'https://' + ip) 
print(r.data)
```
* Use WireShark  to open wireshark.log collected by tcpdump. You will saw IP in SNI (140.211.11.105 in below screenshot)

1296,No User-Agent header by default,2017-12-12T19:42:56Z,,Contributor Friendly ♥,,,"It appears that, by default, urllib3 does not send a `User-Agent` header.

By a plain reading of [RFC-7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3), it appears that user agents SHOULD generally set such a header unless specifically overridden or suppressed:

> A user agent SHOULD send a User-Agent field in each request unless specifically configured not to do so.

I couldn't find prior discussion on this, so it does seem worth talking about. Should we send a User-Agent header by default, and if so, what should it be?

CC @sigmavirus24 in particular for an opinion on the intentions of the RFC. Are we a user agent as described in the document? Or, since we expect to be used for the HTTP-level connectivity of a larger process or library, are we exempt from the requirement?"

As you may recall from #909, @Lukasa has been the lead maintainer of urllib3 for the past year and a half. I am very grateful for Cory's commitment of time and effort, he has done an excellent job pushing urllib3 forward. As employment arrangements change and life marches on, Cory informed me that it's time for a new lead maintainer to take the torch.

## New maintainer

@haikuginger will be taking responsibility as the lead maintainer and thus the direction of urllib3 moving forward.

As before, our family of contributors and secondary maintainers will continue to support our new leader as needed.

## Logistics

This is our second transition, so let's make a checklist of everything that needs to happen for this to be officially complete:

- [x] Announcement
- [ ] Update README
    - @haikuginger's entry in the maintainers' list should include a note that his time is sponsored by Akamai and/or Akamai should be added to the Sponsors list
- [x] Github admin
- [x] PyPI admin
- [x] ReadTheDocs admin
- [ ] TravisCI?
- [ ] AppVeyor?
- [ ] Release process documentation?

Anything else? (Maintainers, please edit the checklist above and check it off as it's completed.)

1285,GzipDecoder assume the input contains only one member,2017-11-28T04:05:01Z,,,,,"gzip files have a property that if you concatenate two gzip files, the result is still considered a gzip file:
```
$ echo hello > a
$ echo world > b
$ gzip a
$ gzip b
$ cat a.gz b.gz > c.gz
$ zcat c.gz
hello
world
```
Since they are still considered a correct gzip file, we should expect such files of ""multiple members"" to be returned by web requests.

When you use zlib to decompress the result, you need special precaution:
```
$ cat pyunzip
#!/usr/bin/env python
import zlib

obj = zlib.decompressobj(16 + zlib.MAX_WBITS)
with open('c.gz') as fin:
    while True:
        data = fin.read(1024 * 1024)
        if data == '':
            break
        inlen = len(data)
        data = obj.decompress(data)
        print inlen, len(data)
$ ./pyunzip
56 6
```
The result is 6 bytes, i.e., only contains the ""hello"" part, without the ""world"" part.  When a web request returns such a file, you end up having a ""truncated"" file as output: the output contains only the first member of the gzip file. You can detect this by the ""unused_data"" member of the decompress object:
```
$ cat pyunzip
#!/usr/bin/env python
import zlib

obj = zlib.decompressobj(16 + zlib.MAX_WBITS)
with open('c.gz') as fin:
    while True:
        data = fin.read(1024 * 1024)
        if data == '':
            break
        inlen = len(data)
        data = obj.decompress(data)
        print inlen, len(data), len(obj.unused_data)
$ ./pyunzip
56 6 28
```
We need to detect the case in the code in order to get the file fully:
```
$ cat pyunzip
#!/usr/bin/env python
import zlib

obj = zlib.decompressobj(16 + zlib.MAX_WBITS)
with open('c.gz') as fin:
    while True:
        if obj.unused_data:
            obj, data = zlib.decompressobj(16 + zlib.MAX_WBITS), obj.unused_data
        else:
            data = fin.read(1024 * 1024)
        if data == '':
            break
        inlen = len(data)
        data = obj.decompress(data)
        print inlen, len(data), len(obj.unused_data)
$ ./pyunzip
56 6 28
28 6 0
```
So we need similar code in `response.py` of urllib3 to support such files.  I tried the following which seemed to work (Python 2.7):
```
    def decompress(self, data):
        if not data:
            return data
        ret = self._obj.decompress(data)
        if self._obj.unused_data:
            self._obj, data \
                = zlib.decompressobj(16 + zlib.MAX_WBITS), self._obj.unused_data
            ret += self._obj.decompress(data)
        return ret

Apparently, they have a reason for not casting it, so it would be nice if `urllib3` did the type check and casting instead. I'd be happy to submit a PR but just wanted to run the idea by you guys first. This could be something as simple as:

```
    def load_cert_chain(self, certfile, keyfile=None, password=None):
        self._ctx.use_certificate_file(certfile)

        self._ctx.use_privatekey_file(keyfile or certfile)

I wanted to check how my code behaves on this slow loading url. I want the ReadTimeoutError error to occur in this situation...

So i made this code to check how urllib handles it:
`from urllib3 import PoolManager, Retry, Timeout`
`p = PoolManager(retries=Retry(0, redirect=0), timeout=Timeout(connect=1.0, read=1.0))`
`r = p.request('get', 'http://kj-art.hs.kr/xboard/board.phpmode=view&number=8306&addUrlQuery=c0NhdD0%5E&page=1&tbnum=77&keyset=&searchword=')`

I ran this code on my Windows PC and on Google Cloud machine running Ubuntu 16.04.

On my Windows I get a ReadTimeoutError real quick.
On the linux i don't get any exceptions. 

On both machines I use python 3.5.2 and urllib3 1.22.

What can cause this problem?

I have tried : 
- urllib3 1.19.1 with requests 2.18.4 works (I have a warning because the version of urllib is too old for requests, doesn't work with higher versions of urllib3)
- urllib3 1.22 with requests 2.12.5 works (doesn't work with higher versions of requests).
- Using gevent.fork or os.fork instead of gipc but it doesn't change the error
- If I do `patch_all(select=False)` it works but without concurrency
- Uploading on s3 with boto3 instead works. 
- Just doing a simple `requests.get(""https://google.fr"")` instead of creating a google_storage & uploading in the parent works. Note that if I only instantiate the google storage client, without uploading, it works.

For now I will go with the version 1.19.1 but it seems that something has been broken since ? Or is it in the requests module ?

1257,Remove race conditions in PoolManager causing ClosedPoolErrors (#1252),2017-09-03T19:40:28Z,,,,,"Fix for #1252. The implementation here is a little clunky for now as I was trying to change the existing code/logic as little as possible to avoid regressions.

List of changes:
* Introduces `test_retry_with_too_many_pools` which shows the `ClosedPoolError` happening in master
* Fixes an issue in the dummyserver's `retry_after` handler in Python 3 when using the default value for status
* Adds a `PersistentRetry` class which wraps `Retry` and allows for the same object to be used after `increment` is called
* Changes the retry logic in `HTTPConnectionPool` and `PoolManager` to loop instead of recurse
* Moves the base `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` functionality to `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen_only` to allow for it to be called by `PoolManager` with no retry logic
* Refactors all retry logic in `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` into `URLOpenWithRetries` which takes a function to call for `urlopen_only` functionality.
  * Both `PoolManager` and `HTTPConnectionPool` end up calling `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen_only` eventually
  * `HTTPConnectionPool`'s logic should be pretty much exactly the same as it was
  * `PoolManager` passes in a function for `urlopen_only` which acquires a pool from `self.pools` then calls `urlopen_only` on it. This means that if `URLOpenWithRetries` ends up retrying (currently will only happen if a `Retry-After` header is received) then `PoolManager` will create a new pool if the old one has been removed, avoiding the `ClosedPoolError` that can happen.
* `PoolManager` acquires `self.pools.lock` a second time now, before running its internal `urlopen_only` logic, to ensure that the lock stays acquired until the `HTTPConnectionPool` calls `_get_conn`. It passes the lock to `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen_only` so that it can release the lock immediately once `_get_conn` is called.

Caveats/Potential improvements:
* Both URLOpenWithRetries and PoolManager still implement different redirect/retry logic. It would be nice to move all retry logic into URLOpenWithRetries.
  * Since `PoolManager` forces `redirect=False` when calling `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen(_only)` there is only the `Retry-After` logic which can potentially cause a race condition on retry. Refactoring this further would reduce the complexity and remove the need for setting `redirect=False`.
* Passing the lock into `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen_only` is a little hacky as currently implemented. It would be nice to have the connection acquiring logic also refactored out so that passing it through like this isn't needed and we can use the lock as a context manager.
* `PersistentRetry` may not be needed. This was implemented to ensure that the retries were maintained properly through the refactor as there are extra calls it may need to be passed through to maintain the context.
* Retry logic changed to loops makes the tracebacks slightly less informative with regards to retries but reduces the frame stack when retrying.
  * This should be able to be reverted if wanted. I originally made this change to make the logic a little easier to reason about and avoid potential issues when refactoring.
* `URLOpenWithRetries` is an odd name
* `URLOpenWithRetries` could possibly be changed to be a mixin, parent class, or wrapper instead of taking a function as a parameter to make its use more obvious
* `{[testenv]setenv}` change may not be needed but I ran into a lot of parsing errors with tox in some environments due to this.

I tested these changes on OSX (10.12.2) and on Ubuntu 16.04 with tox, as well as on travis-ci. There are random test failures, as mentioned in #1256, but the failures seem to correspond with those seen randomly on master in my tests. I have had each tox environment pass with no errors multiple times so I am fairly sure that there are no regressions.

https://travis-ci.org/reversefold/urllib3/builds/271452531 shows a fully passing run of this branch (except for gae, which appears to be broken).

1252,PoolManager is not thread-safe,2017-08-27T05:15:46Z,,,,,"See, for reference this issue on the requests library:
https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/1871

In looking into the issue, which appears to happen when too many hosts are connected to through the same PoolManager in parallel, the issue appears to be with PoolManager's use of an LRU cache for the connection pool instances within it. A pool is pulled from the cache but within the time it takes for pool._get_conn to be called the PoolManager can potentially evict the ConnectionPool if too many other hosts are connected to in parallel.

In addition, since the pool also handles retries and redirects within urlopen, the pool needs to stay alive until the final connection is acquired from the pool, meaning we can't be sure we can release the pool from PoolManager until urlopen returns, essentially making PoolManager make requests serially only.

I only see a few options for fixing this.
1) Remove the LRU cache. This means either connection leaks or hard-limiting the number of hosts that a PoolManager can connect to. Not a very useful option.
2) Put the call(s) to pool.urlopen within a critical section. Basically a no-go as this means that concurrency is useless.
3) Implement ref-counting (a semaphore of some kind) to keep track of pools actually in use and don't allow them to be reaped if they have a reference. This seems complicated and a duplication of Python's own GC. Perhaps this could be implemented by using __del__ to close the pool and not explicitly closing the pool when it is evicted?
4) Refactor PoolManager and the connection pools such that, when using a PoolManager, retries are handled in the PoolManager and we can get up to the point of getting an actual connection out of the pool within a critical section then release the pool to be potentially evicted."

1250,use client cert from keychain in contrib.securetransport,2017-08-24T14:49:50Z,,,,,There doesn't appear to be a method of signaling urllib3.contrib.securetransport to use a client certificate and key that's stored in keychain as opposed to passing one in parameters.   One of the benefits of using securetransport should be to use the keychain to store secrets including the client cert/key.

- Update the `util.selectors._fileobj_to_fd` to accept a `long` value.

1247,test_selectors.py tests fail with python 2.6 64bit and 27 64bit on windows ,2017-08-22T20:43:31Z,2017-08-30T09:04:33Z,,,,"I have noticed that there are a number of tests like the `test_selectors.py::BaseSelectorTestCase::test_register` fail when run against python 2.6 64 bit and python 2.7 64bit.

The error is due to the fact that `socket.fileno()` returns a `long` on python 2.6 and 2.7  (64bits) and the 
[urllib3.util.selectors._fileobj_to_fd](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/util/selectors.py#L41) does not specifically handle that case and the function will finally raise a [ValueError](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/util/selectors.py#L50)

The interesting part is that the error was not picked up by the appveyor tests because tox will use the 32 bit python when running the tests.

Honestly, I'm no longer sure this makes sense. My original goal was to retry different sorts of errors (read, connect, status) once each, the idea being something like: ""it's not worth retrying connect timeout multiple times - if it doesn't answer right away, it probably doesn't answer after 5 retries..."" but at the same time ""let's allow retrying _different_ types or errors on the same go, because maybe proxy just disconnected us, and after re-initializing connection it might throw timeout, that we can also retry once""...

And actually, `ProxyError` (for example) doesn't fall into any category currently, so `other` counter would catch that. However, there are gazillions of potential exceptions in `requests.exceptions`, and this will regard all of them as one, so my idea doesn't quite realize here. Thus, I wonder if this makes any sense...

In the end, it doesn't really do any harm if I just `Retry(3)`... maybe not perfect, but it works and is more flexible..."

I don't think this is easily fixed at the PoolManager level because the API  doesn't give rooms for a way to notify that a ConnectionPool is being used (or is to be released). As such I propose adding a different set of data structures with different APIs to fix this.

```
This causes the connection to not be returned to the pool after calling `stream()` or `read_chunked()` (which `stream()` is a thin wrapper for in this case). This is due to the following conditional in the `read_chunked()` method: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/response.py#L592.

I believe moving this conditional inside the `error_catcher` context manager is the right resolution to this (or calling `release_conn()` explicitly). Will submit a PR for this."

1232,Concurrency Issues on poolmanager.py and _collections.py,2017-07-19T18:02:44Z,2017-07-20T02:28:35Z,,,,"Dear urllib3 developers, 

After reading the source code, I have some questions on the thread-safety of the poolmanager. 

This code: 

  ```
  def connection_from_pool_key(self, pool_key, request_context=None):
        """"""
        Get a :class:`ConnectionPool` based on the provided pool key.
        ``pool_key`` should be a namedtuple that only contains immutable
        objects. At a minimum it must have the ``scheme``, ``host``, and
        ``port`` fields.
        """"""
        with self.pools.lock:
            # If the scheme, host, or port doesn't match existing open
            # connections, open a new ConnectionPool.
            pool = self.pools.get(pool_key)
            if pool:
                return pool

            # Make a fresh ConnectionPool of the desired type
            scheme = request_context['scheme']
            host = request_context['host']
            port = request_context['port']
            pool = self._new_pool(scheme, host, port, request_context=request_context)
            self.pools[pool_key] = pool

        return pool

```

It seems that it only locks the pool operation. However, it does not lock between after the pool is created and before the connection is made. During this gap, the connection could be closed by the following code: 

```
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        evicted_value = _Null
        with self.lock:
            # Possibly evict the existing value of 'key'
            evicted_value = self._container.get(key, _Null)
            self._container[key] = value

            # If we didn't evict an existing value, we might have to evict the
            # least recently used item from the beginning of the container.
            if len(self._container) > self._maxsize:
                _key, evicted_value = self._container.popitem(last=False)

        if self.dispose_func and evicted_value is not _Null:
            self.dispose_func(evicted_value)
```

The RLock will be released after the connectionpool operation is completed. If the RLock is released, and another thread tries to operate on the connection pool - the existing connection could be evicted. Any call on the evicted connection could fail. 

I also looked at the source code that calls the `urlopen` function, and it seems that it is called without any lock whatsoever. It is either a plain HTTPConnectionPool object or a HTTPSConnectionPool object. 

It seems that after the new pool is created and added to the connection pool, no more thread-safety is guaranteed. 

Is this an issue, or is it just me mis-interpreting the code? 

Thanks,

Jinhua "
1231,Use vendored version of ``six`` in pyopenssl.,2017-07-19T15:37:52Z,2017-07-20T07:32:28Z,,,,"Fixes import errors like https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/4886 when importing `requests`. Everywhere else in `contrib` vendors properly; it looks like we just missed a spot.

If this looks good, could we please have a 1.21.2 release soon so Let's Encrypt doesn't have to work around this in a zillion OS packages? I expect this problem is widespread, since any import of `requests` without a suitable `six` also installed could trigger it. [pip may even be hitting it](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/2902), though I haven't dug into that deeply. Many thanks!"
1230,Stamp out a bunch of warnings in the tests,2017-07-18T06:30:37Z,,,,,"The test suite emits a lot of warnings (63 on [this recent Travis run](https://travis-ci.org/shazow/urllib3/jobs/254519138)).

These warnings are mostly benign, but they’re mixed in with real problems, such as #1100. This patch causes the test suite to emit substantially fewer warnings, meaning the interesting ones will be easier to spot. It also cleans up another two leaked FDs."
1229,Fix compatibility for cookiejar,2017-07-17T12:17:29Z,2017-07-17T16:53:10Z,,,,"py3 cookiejar expects `get_all()` from header objects and `info()` from response objects. This PR adds the necessary compatibility methods and a test for that in `test_compatibility`. `getlist()` needs to get a default argument, to serve as a dropin for the required `get_all()`. I opted for extending `getlist` instead of reinventing the wheel by creating a separate `get_all`, not sure if you agree here."
1228,Urllib3 with h11 and trio,2017-07-15T04:20:19Z,2017-07-15T06:34:12Z,,,,I've been following trio development these last few months and asynchronous HTTP requests are unsurprisingly high on my wish list.  @njsmith suggested urllib3 was probably the best way to robustly achieve this (https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/105).  I've noted that removing httplib has been closed (https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/1067) and that the v2 branch hasn't been updated since May.   Does this mean we are close?  If not what additional work needs to be done? 
1227,"When sending chunked requests, allow chunk body iterator to format chunks on its own",2017-07-01T20:42:31Z,2017-07-02T07:02:32Z,,,,"I'm working with a service that wants me to upload chunked requests with chunk extensions -

Wiki\r\n
5;CUSTOM_CHUNK_EXTENSION\r\n
pedia\r\n
0;CUSTOM_CHUNK_EXTENSION\r\n

I think the easiest way to accommodate this would be with a kwarg like `PoolManager.request(body=chunk_iterator, raw_chunks=True)`. This would optionally delegate the responsibility for formatting the chunks to the body iterator."

1224,"when connecting to https by IP address, client hello message has a server_name SNI block with literal ip address",2017-06-26T10:51:20Z,,,,,"I originally opened this in [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4178), but was asked to raise it here.

When connecting to a machine over https using an IP address, the SSL client hello includes a server_name extension with the ip address listed as the server name. This is not allowed in the [SNI spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3546#section-3.1), and it should not include the server_name extension. 

Reproduce:
1. Set up packet logging
2. ```python
    import urllib3
    http = urllib3.PoolManager()
    http.request('GET', 'https://8.8.8.8')

        self._ctx.use_privatekey_file(keyfile or certfile)

1209,Add support for DNS hijacking,2017-06-06T19:33:31Z,,,,,"This is more of a naive approach and maybe the API is too intrusive, but we can change that.

First I started by comparing the hosts, without support for ports (as `curl` have in its `--resolve` argument).
In that implementation it made sense to use `hijack_dns_resolver`, since it map a host to a custom ip.

Since I've added support for ports, maybe `hijack_dns_resolver` is not the good, but I liked the name so I kept it. I'm open to change it (maybe `hijack_resolver` or just `resolver` is better)."

I can't seem to get a self signed cert accepted by urllib3, either by providing the single cer directly to verify (tried exporting it in a variety of formats), or by appending it to the pem downloaded by certifi.

I'm not sure this is the right place to ask, but the groups for the certifi/urllib3/requests seemed a bit overlapping (and I have no idea how to reproduce it using raw ssl package requests)... and I was wondering if there could be any improvement of error clarity in the packages handling of cert failures.

 - what format exactly is certifi/urllib3 expecting for it's pem files (and how could folks use python tools like ssl.get_server_certificate to properly create one with all the Pound extras before the begin cert)?

 - How can I track down exactly what urllib3/ssl is complaining about when I have an (apparently) malformed cert file and get:
...
urllib3.exceptions.SSLError: unknown error (_ssl.c:3517)

 - Or when I use a raw get_server_certificate file with line breaks that seems to be read fine and imported fine to windows, but is ignored for certification with many layers of:

The change introduced ~22 test failures, all of them due to the fact that requests failed due to SSL errors now raise a `MaxRetryError`, and not an `SSLError`. I adapted these tests, also checking that  `MaxRetryError.reason` is an `SSLError`.

As mentioned in #1112, this is somewhat backwards incompatible: if clients explicitly handle `SSLError` exceptions, they now need to catch `MaxRetryError` instead and check if `reason` is an `SSLError`.

I didn't add an explicit test, since the new behaviour is tested implicitly in a lot of existing tests. Is that ok?"

Sadly, it turns out that resolving #1149 required a pretty substantial rethink of the underlying sending loop in the v2 branch. A lot of the code was subtly mishandling expectations: for example, it's not at all unreasonable for a TLS connection to become readable during upload, and that's not an error: it is just triggering a TLS renegotiation. So we needed to become a bit smarter about error handling there.

Ultimately, this has required a big rewrite and the addition of a brand new bit of testing harness. We now have a sort-of DSL for testing low-level socket activity in the sync_connection, which allows us to tightly control exactly what happens in the low-level sockets and selectors. That transitions us into a purely-deterministic world in which nothing unexpected happens. Ultimately this may be a better testing approach than even the socket-level tests, at the cost of being divorced from ""actual network behaviour""."

*Use case:* I am calling an API that requires a valid authentication token. If token is not valid, API returns 401 as usual.

The problem is that our identity provider reserves right to flush all existing tokens at any point of time. Or maybe the token gets revoked (for reason X). So, the client may face a situation, where the otherwise valid token suddenly doesn't work anymore. Client needs to fetch a new token.

I already implemented a custom `Retry` class that refreshes my token. However, the problem is that the new token is not taken into use in the retry attempt, because headers are fixed and immutable at that point. If I could adjust headers inside `Retry.is_retry()` or `Retry.increment()` or somewhere, that would allow me to actually inject the new token into the retry..."

I would also like to actually test it on Jython and if that's not possible in our CI setup perhaps make some `mock` tests that simulate a `socket` that returns itself from `fileno()`.

```python

So far I've hit two problems:

Id' advocate just skipping these tests on Python versions without a correct SSLContext.

I am suggesting this change because for some systems it is
better to use all the connections from the pool equally, rather than the
same ones all the time, which is the default case with LIFO.

In our case, it improves reliability because our servers are behind an
ELB. Once there is a failure and we have to retry the request, we don't
want to reuse the same connection, but rather start a different connection
in the hope that the ELB will choose a different machine to respond.

Furthermore, an online search leads me to believe that FIFO is a commonly
used data structure in connection pools:

Given that we will now need to migrate our testing infrastructure away from nose, we should consider where we need to move. My suggestion would be to move to `py.test`: writing tests for `py.test` is generally a nicer experience than writing traditional unittest style tests, and it has fewer requirements to do weird unittest importing. However, I'm happy to get feedback from the other contributors about what they'd like to do.

The work required to complete this would be as follows:

- [ ] Initial PR to move from nosetests as the test runner to the new runner, with only the changes to the testing we actually need to get those tests to run.
- [ ] Subsequent PRs to incrementally migrate our test suite to the style of the new runner, instead of unittest style, if applicable.

I am trying to use urllib connectionpool.request so that when we get a status code that is in the status_forcelist, the same connection isn't reused for the retries. I tried using `release_conn=False` and then calling `.release_conn()`, but by inspecting the code, it looks like this is only releasing the last used connection. 
Assuming that we fail the 1st try and then we succeed the 2nd, the 1st connection is never released. Then I imagine we would have a problem of leaking connections.
Is this a bug, or is there something I'm missing here?

1153,SecureTransport backend can lead to long pauses on Python 3.,2017-04-25T14:04:44Z,2017-04-27T07:00:32Z,,,,"Spotted by someone testing out pip with SecureTransport backing via the new urllib3.

The symptom is this: if you take pip from the branch on pypa/pip#4454, install it on Python 3, and run `pip install -I --no-cache-dir django` you'll find it takes a surprisingly long time. If you do the same on Python 2, it takes something around 7 seconds, while on Python 3 it can take more than 40! This is clearly not a good sign.

I've spent some time debugging this, and I have an explanation of what's going on. I'm going to write it out at length to help people understand the moving parts here, and to help understand why I've chosen the fix approach that I have.

The major relevant difference between Python 2 and Python 3 is their approach to buffering inside httplib. Specifically, Python 3 uses the fancy `io.BufferedReader`, while Python 2 does not (because it didn't exist when httplib was originally written). On Python 3, when making a `HTTPResponse.read` call, the objects involved are, in order: `http.client.HTTPResponse`, `io.BufferedReader`, `socket.SocketIO`, `securetransport.WrappedSocket`, and `socket.socket`.

`io.BufferedReader` has an interesting mechanism. It is initialized with a buffer size (by default 8192 bytes). When asked to read some bytes, it checks how many it was asked for. If the size is greater than the buffer, it'll just pass the read straight through and won't bother attempting to do any buffering (this was something of a surprise for me). However, when asked to read *less* than the buffer size it'll attempt to fill its buffer. It does this by passing its own internal buffer to the lower-level `readinto` function and asking for that buffer to be filled. This means that if httplib issues a `read` for fewer than 8192 bytes, in most cases the `io.BufferedReader` will intercept that call and ask for a read of 8192 bytes instead.

Interestingly, in most cases pip will circumvent the buffered reader. The buffering is used a bit early on when reading headers, but once pip starts reading the body it does so by using `iter_content(10240)`, which issues reads sized at 10240 bytes. This, eagle-eyed readers will notice, is larger than the buffer size of the `io.BufferedReader`, and so it will mostly stay out of the way. This changes only once: when reading the last segment of the body. At this time, httplib will notice that a `read` of 10240 bytes was asked for but only, say, 5192 bytes are left in the body, and so it will quietly clamp the read down to 5192 bytes before issuing the read to `io.BufferedReader`. At this point, `io.BufferedReader`, the hero of the day, will think ""NOW IS MY TIME"" and leap in and quietly *re-expand* the read to 8192 bytes before it passes it further on down the line. This is despite the fact that any *human being* could have told it that there will be no extra data to buffer (""the response is over, goddamn it!"").

Now, for other TLS backends this does not matter, but for SecureTransport it does. This is because our ST backend just calls `SSLRead` with the buffer provided by the higher level (which in this case is 8192 bytes long). And, it turns out, that `SSLRead` *also* buffers. That is, when asked to read 8192 bytes, it will damn well do so until it gets a read that times out before *any* data is returned. If even one byte is returned by the timeout then it will keep issuing calls to the read callback until it is done or it gets a true timeout.

Here is the issue. httplib asked for exactly the number of bytes it needed. If `io.BufferedReader` hadn't tried to be helpful by over-reading, `SSLRead()` would have been asked for that many application bytes, and so would have returned directly. But it *wasn't*, and so it elected to keep issuing reads. This meant that after it had read the 5192 bytes httplib needed SecureTransport issued *another* socket read, which waited for the timeout before failing to read and causing `SSLRead` to return with `errSSLWouldBlock`. This is where our long delay happens: this will happen once for each package pip downloads. To put it in a TL;DR kinda way, we have two layers doing buffering, and they're getting in each other's way.

So, how do we fix it? As far as I can tell, there's really only one way: stop the `io` module from doing any buffering when we use SecureTransport. Anything else involves trying to second-guess whether the `io` module is just trying to fill its own buffer or whether it actually needs the buffering. This other approach allows SecureTransport to continue to do the buffering it wants to do, without getting in the way.

The risk here is that there is some code somewhere in httplib that assumes it can get a `BufferedReader` unconditionally. I certainly hope that doesn't exist."

Use case: I want to all one retry for read/connect/status-retry, but if I do `Retry(total=3, connect=1, read=1, status_forcelist=[...])` then in case there is no connect or read error, status will be retried 3 times, unless I'm mistaken."

This centralises all redirect handling code into the PoolManager, where it needs to be to handle cross-host redirects. ConnectionPool objects are no longer capable of doing redirects.

This has meant both that there is a bunch of awkward code duplication in read() *and* that stream() became very inefficient, as it was doing buffered I/O.

This change adjusts stream so that it no longer does buffered I/O, and rewrites read() to be in terms of stream. This should help clean things up for writing an async response object in future. Along the way I've made some miscellaneous smaller changes."

1122,[WIP] Add support for using SecureTransport as a TLS provider.,2017-02-17T14:03:33Z,2017-04-25T09:59:28Z,,,,"This is somewhat unexpected patch, but here we are. Let me explain what's going on.

A few months ago, @dstufft announced that [Fastly would be transitioning the Python Package Index over to being a TLSv1.2-only service](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-January/029970.html). The hard cut-off for this event would be June 2018.

By-and-large this does not affect most pip users. Users on Windows will generally have OpenSSLs shipped by python.org, which have tended to support TLSv1.2. The same is largely true of Linux users, most of whom have OpenSSL 1.0.1 or higher, which have TLSv1.2 support. This means that pip users on those platforms will largely be unaffected.

However, anyone using the *system* Python, or most Pythons obtained from python.org, on macOS is in deep trouble. This is because those Pythons all link against the system-provided OpenSSL, which is OpenSSL v0.9.8zh. This unconscionably ancient OpenSSL does not support TLSv1.2. As a result, any pip on those systems would find itself unable to contact the Python package index sometime in June 2018. This event would be, as our friends in the Physics community refer to it, ""an inconvenience"".

Because pip uses Requests, and Requests uses urllib3, the easiest way to solve this problem is to add a SecureTransport shim to urllib3, much like the PyOpenSSL shim that already exists. This would enable macOS users to use the SecureTransport TLS library that Apple has shipped with them instead of using OpenSSL for their TLS purposes, thereby avoiding the fustercluck that is the OpenSSL on that platform. This PR does exactly that.

There are some caveats and limitations on this Pull Request that need to be understood. They are:

1. This PR *must* use ctypes. This is because pip cannot ship any code that requires compilation. As a result, this PR contains a substantial amount of code to provide ctypes bindings to a large chunk of macOS libraries.
2. It is very difficult to turn off hostname validation for SecureTransport in such a way that urllib3 can continue to use its own hostname validation logic. For this reason, I have simply chosen not to do that and instead to exempt ST from hostname checking in urllib3. This means that `assert_hostname` does not work with ST. For the moment I'm ok with that, though I'd like to see if any maintainers disagree with that choice.
3. This currently completely ignores any options setting. I'm inclined to continue to do that.
4. This code does not support OpenSSL cipher strings, because I just could not be bothered to write parsing code for them.
5. This code does not work for Python 2.6, because Python 2.6 has no memoryview object. I could write my way out of that bind, but @dstufft has indicated that he doesn't care and frankly I don't think I do either.
6. Amusingly, while this code does work with `assert_fingerprint`, it does *not* disable hostname verification when `assert_fingerprint` is being used. That means that for ST `assert_fingerprint` *and* hostname validation need to match, whereas for other options just `assert_fingerprint` has to match.
7. This code does not work on older Macs (older than about 10.8). That's almost certainly fine: Mac users tend to be aggressive upgraders.

There is some work still to do here:

- [x] Take complete control of timeouts away from the socket, so that Python doesn't create new selectors under our feet.
- [x] Add locking around the connection ref dictionary to enable thread-safety.
- [x] Handle the `protocol` argument.
- [x] Add support for client certs.

However, as this is now beginning to work I wanted to make this available so that the interested parties can start looking at it and thinking about how we want to handle it. In particular, I have a few questions:

1. Should urllib3 ever actually ship this? It's a bunch of code that favours one platform (macOS) over another equally-deserving one (Windows). It adds a *load* of extra code to do that, which we'd have to support.
2. If urllib3 supports it, should Requests optimistically auto-enable it like it does with PyOpenSSL?
3. Does this cover all of `pip`'s needs?"

I'm pretty sure the problem is caused by an invalid HTTP header returned by the server:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Sat, 04 Feb 2017 19:16:34 GMT
    My Param: None
    [...]

It directly follows the Date response header, which is returned fine, but since no other response headers is returned, I think this broken header is breaking the HTTP response headers parser.

Of note: the `http.client.HTTPresponse.headers` object (`HTTPMessage`) shows all headers in `_payload`, but only the `Date` header in `_headers`."

It introduces a brand new connection class that is vastly stripped down compared to what httplib offered, including a very limited set of functionality. It rewrites that connection to use selectors rather than blocking socket I/O, enabling us to abort request sending for early responses (a regularly requested feature).

It also allows us to begin blasting through the code removing stuff, which is a huge win.

This is something that I'd like people to look over at a high level. Obviously, detailed review is difficult, but another set of eyes on this would be really helpful."

1096,Improve support for path-only URLs.,2017-01-18T10:32:44Z,,,,,"Encountered while doing a substantial backend rewrite for v2.

Currently, `parse_url` doesn't do well with non-urlencoded URLs that are intended to have no host portion, as frequently used by HTTP Location headers:

```python
>>> from urllib3.util.url import parse_url
>>> parse_url('/redirect?target=http://localhost:61020/')
Url(scheme='/redirect?target=http', auth=None, host='localhost', port=61020, path='/', query=None, fragment=None)
```

As you can see here, the `://` in the URL confuses urllib3's URL handling logic, which means it ends up incorrectly assuming that the scheme is `/redirect?target=http`. This is causing problems in the v2 backend, which uses `parse_url` to attempt to isolate out the request URL to put into the HTTP/1.1 request.

Frustratingly, urlparse gets this right:

```python
>>> from urllib.parse import urlparse
>>> urlparse('/redirect?target=http://localhost:61020/')
ParseResult(scheme='', netloc='', path='/redirect', params='', query='target=http://localhost:61020/', fragment='')
```
It would be good if `parse_url` could spot a URL that is path-only and handle it sensibly.

This is part of a larger problem, which is that `parse_url` and the `Url` class cannot be used to incrementally build up a URL target. This is required to emulate browser logic for redirects if that's a thing that we want to do: it needs to be possible to handle all URLs that could be returned in Location headers, including absolute, scheme-relative, absolute-path, and path-relative, but right now urllib3 can't really do that.

The larger issue doesn't block v2, but this does. It's probably something that @sigmavirus24 could give guidance on if someone wants to pick it up."
1095,Add fast path for system call wrapper on Python 3.5+,2017-01-18T02:23:03Z,2017-01-20T09:46:45Z,,,,"I've updated my selectors2 project to 1.1.0 and the main feature added is a fast path the system call wrapper on Python 3.5+. This wrapper can be substantially smaller and faster because in Python 3.5+ PEP 475 is implemented which automatically retries system calls in the case of an interrupt. I figured I would propagate these changes here to make sure urllib3 is getting everything out of its selectors upgrade. :tada:

Overall the wrapper performs about **126% faster** with a happy path and **36% faster** with an error path.

This version also catches and correctly handles an error on Windows platforms when trying to call `BaseSelector.unregister` on a closed socket where the previous version did not."

Basically, read_chunked should check whether `_fp` is `None`. If it is, it should immediately return the empty byte string rather than do any processing.

```python
import urllib3

http = urllib3.PoolManager()
resp = http.request('GET', 'http://http2bin.org/stream/100')
resp.read()
next(resp.read_chunked())

1087,Custom LifoQueue,2017-01-06T15:46:50Z,,,,,"During some profiling, I found out one slow operation is `self.pool.get()` in `_get_conn()`.

Which uses a list instead of a much faster deque:
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/queue.py#L237

My suggestion is one could use a custom LifoQueue that uses the underlying deque, as:

#911 introduced normalizing both the host and scheme to lowercase which is valid for http URIs. Requests however was supporting the passing of percent-encoded file paths with the http+unix:// scheme which is now broken as of Requests 2.12.0 (urllib3 1.17+). @Lukasa [suggested](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/3738#issuecomment-268883231) we could restrict host normalization to a specific set of schemes to avoid breaking case-dependent URLs.

What we want to do is only run [this check](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/4851f6d5e23851b497cd30cac89ebcabf5b8853c/urllib3/util/url.py#L24-L25) when there is a specified scheme and it is inside of a predefined set of normalizable schemes (http://, https://, ?).

1074,Draft pipeline architecture,2016-12-23T05:44:16Z,,,,,"@Lukasa and I had discussed a possible architecture alteration for V2. Instead of having `PoolManager` encapsulate `ConnectionPool`, `SessionManager` encapsulate `PoolManager`, and so on, each of these high-level objects would be built as a pipeline of vastly-simplified steps, each of which would be entirely self-contained.

This pull request is a draft of a first step towards doing that. It adds [a pipeline architecture I've been working on](https://github.com/haikuginger/httppipeline), and refactors `PoolManager` into a set of individual pipeline elements.

As this is quite speculative, I haven't written tests for it yet; this is more of a proof-of-concept for discussion.

For right now, this isn't integrated with `RequestMethods` (which would be broken down into a couple pipeline elements of its own); to test it, do the following:

```python
from urllib3.pipeline.poolmanager import PoolManagerPipeline
pm = PoolManagerPipeline()
```

From there, doing `pm.request()` should behave similarly to `PoolManager.urlopen()`, with the exception of not taking positional arguments. Positional arguments could be added with an API-level pipeline element.

Future benefits include the ability to build small, easily-reusable modules. For example, we could add a `CookiePipelineElement` that sat near the base level, handling cookies on each request that passes through and response that passes back. We'd also be able to test individual elements as units much more easily without substantial mocking.

Pinging @jonparrott, @Lukasa, @SethMichaelLarson, @shazow, and @sigmavirus24 to take a look and drop their opinions. If people are happy with the overall architecture, then I'll continue working on it."

1070,localhost DNS resolution problem in tests with misconfigured /etc/hosts,2016-12-13T13:22:58Z,2016-12-13T13:23:04Z,,,,"[After further investigation, I figured out the problem here was either an old or just plain misconfigured `/etc/hosts`, but decided it made the most sense to submit the issue anyway and then immediately close it, in case someone else runs into a similar problem]

Running the tests on Fedora 25, I found an interesting failure case for the ""Does an IPv6 local loopback actually work?"" checks in the DummyServer implementation. Specifically (the port number below comes from starting a SocketDummyServerTestCase test case in an interactive Python shell):

```
$ netstat -tl | grep 37677
tcp6       0      0 localhost6.locald:37677 [::]:*                  LISTEN
$ ping localhost -c 1
PING localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
...
$ ping localhost6 -c 1
PING localhost6(localhost6.localdomain6 (::1)) 56 data bytes
```

What appeared to be happening was that `socket.bind()` accepted `""localhost""` as a valid interface name to bind to, so the dummy server code at https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/dummyserver/server.py#L53 sets `HAS_IPV6_AND_DNS` and binds to `::1`, but when the client tries to *resolve* `""localhost""` it gets handed `127.0.0.1`, which then doesn't work.

Using Charles-François's queries from https://bugs.python.org/issue18792 I saw:

```

```

Which sounded a lot like the problems discussed in https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/611

However checking a fresh Fedora container image suggests that the expectation is for `localhost` to be used for both IPv4 and IPv6, and my local workstation just has some old config settings lying around:

```
$ docker run --rm fedora:25 cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.2      3fe6f8fb4bb1
```

So I edited `/etc/hosts` to also list `localhost` on the `::1` line and the test issue went away."
1069,Stop supporting read_chunked and friends.,2016-12-12T14:26:46Z,2016-12-13T12:38:00Z,,,,"This patch removes support for `read_chunked` and all its supporting methods. We agreed to remove these because supporting the functionality whereby we'd expose chunked bodies to the user is not all that useful.

We should consider whether `stream` should swap over to using `read1` instead of `read`, but that's a different patch: see https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/projects/1#card-1081219."
1068,Work for v2 of urllib3.,2016-12-12T13:33:08Z,,,,,"This is a follow-on from #1067. This meta-PR is used primarily to allow a single, easy place to see what work has been done and is being done for v2.

Smaller work items:

- Remove support for respecting chunked bodies as part of `stream`. (#1069)"
1067,[WIP] Remove httplib.,2016-12-08T15:15:25Z,2016-12-12T13:33:20Z,,,,"This branch contains the most substantial chunk of work I have ever done on urllib3: the beginnings of an effort to remove our dependency on httplib.

Removing our dependency on httplib has been a long-held desire of the urllib3 project. In fact, it's so desired that #776 (our wishlist of features for v2.0) includes in a section entitled ""unlikely longshots"" the phrase ""Get rid of httplib dependence"".

This branch does exactly that, by bringing the `http.client` implementation from Python 3.5 that we were already used to interacting with into our codebase and then ripping its guts out and replacing them with @njsmith's [h11](https://github.com/njsmith/h11) library.

As you can see from the commit log, my work on this began back in October, but I've sat on it for the past two months in order to get it to a place where I had something worth showing. Now I finally do. On my machine, a run of `tox -e py27` passes all tests, albeit with incomplete test coverage:

```

Initially, my goal was to do this in the least-disruptive way possible: that's why I began by trying to replicate the logic of httplib inside urllib3 but on top of h11. I would have succeeded in that goal if I'd been able to avoid rewriting any tests in any substantive way.

Unfortunately, as you can see from this change, I did not succeed at that. In particular, it was simply not possible to continue with some behaviours that urllib3 had previously promised, such as maintaining header case. I also had to bend over backwards to preserve some other behaviours urllib3 users have expected, such as reporting chunk boundaries, which is probably not something we should ever have promised to do.

From my perspective, then, I think that if we want to continue this work it needs to be considered a breaking change for urllib3. Any change this substantial simply cannot be done in a non-breaking way. A huge number of things will change: our tolerance of errors (we're much stricter now because h11 is much more insistent about being spec-compliant), our wire format (h11 does some case normalization on header field names), and maybe even some of our output formats.

This is also still very much a work in progress. There are TODO statements everywhere. The code is poorly factored: it's a wacky in-between state between trying to maintain the httplib abstraction and a total rejection of it in favour of something much clearer. A whole lot of our code that worked around httplib flaws is no longer necessary and can be removed, but hasn't yet been. A better underlying implementation that doesn't perform socket writes would also be possible, as would some refactoring of code I wrote to pull out common features. And the Python 3 tests don't pass, mostly because of the fact that right now this new branch emits headers as bytestrings rather than unicode strings.

However, at this point it's no longer feasible for me to work on this branch alone. Further progress requires actual governance decisions, and I am not qualified to make those on my own, nor should I. urllib3 has a great collection of core maintainers and regular contributors whose opinions and work I value, and would like to solicit to help me. As I see it, we need to answer the following questions:

1. Is this worth doing? Do we want to be rid of httplib so badly that we will perform a *massive* codebase rewrite to get rid of it?
2. If so, are we happy with using h11?
    1. If we are, do we depend on it using pip, or vendor it? How does our decision affect Requests?
3. Should this be the beginning of a v2.0 branch that will contain other bits of work from #776?
    1. If it should, how many breakages do we want to roll into one change? Do we want to go all in and leave a *massive* codebase change?
4. What pieces of functionality do we want to retain from the old codebase? In particular, do we want:
    1. To still have `stream()` expose chunk boundaries?
    2. To return `str` header field names and values on Python 3?
    3. To return *different types* for header field names and values on Python 3?
    4. To implement buffered I/O in the low-level primitives?
    5. To maintain the weird two-level Response structure where we have a urllib3 `Response` object that contains a httplib `Response` object within it?
5. How would we want to manage a rollout of this functionality?
6. How do we want to review it?
7. What kind of timeline do we want for releasing it?
8. If we decide to go ahead with a v2.0, should we freeze the current master branch for everything except bug/security fixes until we complete v2.0?

When @shazow originally made me interim lead maintainer, he told me that I had complete authority because he could always undo any change I made that he didn't like. I think this particular change is an exception: I don't think I have any degree of ""lead maintainer"" authority on this. We're going to need @shazow to express some opinions too.

While I'm here, I'd also like to tag a few community members that are particularly likely to be interested in this proposal:

1065,what is the official relation between urllib3 and upstream python?,2016-12-06T10:33:41Z,,,,,"Given that urllib and urllib2 are part of the core-libs, it doesn't seem unrealistic that at some point a urllib3 will be part of the core-libs.

This approach does require doing an allocation of an `X509` object to verify that the expected private attribute is available.

I also modified the tests as the previous attempt to check `successfully_injected` would not work as it was never set to True (when the assertion failed it would jump immediately into the `finally` block). It isn't unsafe to always call `extract_from_urllib3` so now it always does."
1062,"Bug: Content-Disposition Header Lacking ""filename"" When ""filename*"" Is Present",2016-12-01T16:04:07Z,,"Contributor Friendly ♥, Someday",,,"#### Description:
When sending files to a server that does not understand ""filename*"" parameters inside the Content-Disposition header, the server will fail to find the file name because the ""filename"" parameter is not also included.

#### Justification:
According to [RFC 6266](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266#appendix-D), ideal header generators will include both a ""filename"" and a ""filename*"" parameter whenever the ""filename*"" form is required:
> – Include a ""filename*"" parameter where the desired filename cannot be expressed faithfully using the ""filename"" form.  Note that legacy user agents will not process this, and will fall back to using the ""filename"" parameter's content.
>
> – When a ""filename*"" parameter is sent, to also generate a ""filename"" parameter as a fallback for user agents that do not support the ""filename*"" form, if possible.  This can be done by substituting characters with US-ASCII sequences (e.g., Unicode character point U+00E4 (LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIARESIS) by ""ae"").  Note that this may not be possible in some locales.
>
> – When a ""filename"" parameter is included as a fallback (as per above), ""filename"" should occur first, due to parsing problems in some existing implementations.

#### Why I Care:
This inconsistency caused a many-hour debugging session when trying to discover why file uploads to Google AppEngine blobstore stopped working when the requests library was upgraded (which bundles urllib3 with install). The eventual resolution was to urlencode the file name to a `str` before upload so that the ""filename*"" parameter was not added.

1059,Read timeout causes retry despite HTTP method used,2016-11-29T17:18:05Z,2016-12-16T13:03:51Z,Contributor Friendly ♥,,,"Hello,

We've encountered an issue in which a read timeout will always cause a retry (unless the *read* parameter to the *Retry* class is set to 0), no matter what HTTP method is used to perform the request. Part of the code path that is followed seems to be https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/7002c1347c677b2743244bf36bd05aa3625f57f1/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L642.
To give more context, we're encountering retries on POST requests (which are not indempotent) when a server's response time causes a read timeout.

Is this known behaviour? We were expecting the *method_whitelist* parameter to apply to any type of errors.

Thanks."

1047,"""buffering"" arg support is checked on every call to `ConnectionCls.getresponse()` in HTTPConnectionPool",2016-11-22T08:31:27Z,,,,,"On Python 3.5 with urllib3 1.15, I just hit the issue discussed in https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1289#issuecomment-31294851 where urllib3 is checking for `buffering` parameter support first, and then falling back to calling `getresponse()` without any arguments, creating a misleading stack trace when the latter call fails.

Thanks to https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/commit/7fa026c37a5326dcaf97cb9c66ecd15df9c1a194 more recent versions of urllib3 won't show the confusing chained traceback when a connection fails.

However, it's also the case that on every current Python version *except* Python 2.7, the first call will always fail (and even on Python 2.7 it's relying on an undocumented parameter, so not all Python implementations will support it).

This problem could be eliminated by checking for the relevant signature information once at import time rather than on every call to `getresponse`:

    def _request_response_buffering():
        try:
            names = HTTPConnection.getresponse.im_func.func_code.co_varnames
        except AttributeError:
            return False # Either Python 3 or not CPython
        return ""buffering"" in names

    if _request_response_buffering():
        def _getresponse(conn):
            return conn.getresponse(buffering=True)
    else:
        _getresponse = HTTPConnection.getresponse

And then calling `_getreponse(conn)` instead of `conn.getresponse()`

If such an approach would be acceptable, then I'd be happy to create a PR for it.

1046,Necessary to cleanup DefaultSelector in def _wait_for_io_events() ?,2016-11-22T07:28:56Z,2016-12-23T16:51:52Z,,,,"Hello,

We are hitting the error ""filedescriptor out of range in select()""  when creating too many new connections. We are using urllib3 as a part of requests. In order to get around it we are waiting for https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/1001 to get released. The questions I have are:

1. When will https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/1001 be released as part of a new urllib3 release?
2. I was looking at the patch and was wondering if any cleanup is required for the DefaultSelector() object that is created in the util._wait_for_io_events() function. See https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/util/wait.py#L22. The epoll selector class does have the close() method where it closes the platform epoll object - but is the close() called from anywhere?

1045,Require an up-to-date 'cryptography' module for urllib3 injection,2016-11-21T22:50:36Z,2016-11-23T19:26:14Z,,,,This fixes Issue #1044 for me.
1044,"Old ""cryptography"" package causes crash",2016-11-21T19:47:01Z,2016-11-23T19:27:25Z,,,,"Cross-posting this from kennethreitz/requests#3714 ; folks there seemed to think that this would be best addressed within urllib3:

As of `requests==2.12.1` \[EDIT: and whatever version of urllib3 it embeds\], `requests[security]` depends on `cryptography>=1.3.4`.  That's fine.  However, `requests` (without `[security]`) crashes if `cryptography==1.0.2` is installed.  This is a perfectly valid configuration of packages according to `pip`; as a user, I would expect it to behave as if I had not specified `[security]` (because I didn't specify it).

The specific failure is discussed a bit more here:

http://discuss.flexget.com/t/unhandled-error-in-plugin-configure-series-solved/2900

The crash was resolved, also as described at the above link, by running:

```
pip install --upgrade cryptography
```

Uninstalling `cryptography` would probably have worked fine too.

The crash appears to be caused because `requests` internally tests for `[security]` by importing a thing which imports its bundled `pyopenssl` which imports `cryptography`; if that succeeds, the extra is used.  But with a too-old version of `cryptography`, it imports just fine but it constructs objects that are missing required fields.

I can think of a couple approaches here:

* Catch this failure and print an error message that more-helpfully explains that your `cryptography` package needs updating
* Validate the version/functionality of the `cryptography`package more carefully, and don't enable the `[security]` extra's features if an old version happens to be installed

I'd be happy to post a PR for either approach.  Right now I'm looking for feedback on whether it's worth addressing this (I'd certainly appreciate it) and on what approach you'd prefer."
1043,Support for certificate subject when using subjectAltName=IP Address is broken,2016-11-16T20:43:57Z,2016-11-16T20:54:30Z,,,,"Since I upgraded to Urllib3 v.1.19.1, Some certificate stopped to be valid. I realized that the code does not verify the subject of the certificate anymore if an IPAddress entry is present in the SubjectAltName when using the hostname to query.

Steps to reproduce
---

1. Setup a https host with a certificate with a CommonName in the subject and an IP address in the subjectAltName (without any DNSname)
2. Query the hostname of the host using this certificate.
    
Incorrect Behavior
---
    
The CommonName of the certificate will be ignored and the verification will fail

    [exec] requests.packages.urllib3.connection: ERROR: Certificate did not match expected hostname: $HOSTNAME. Certificate: {'subjectAltName': (('IP Address', '$IP'),), 'subject': ((('commonName', u'*.$DOMAIN'),),), 'notAfter': '$TIMESTAMP'}

My analysis
---

I think the issue was introduced with the [PR#922] which introduce the verification of IP Address in the SubjectAltName. [Following the logic introduced], If a IP Address is specified in the SubjectAltName, the code adds it to the dnsnames list, causing the CommonName of the certificate to be ignored.

I think the intended behavior is to support CommonName presemt in the Subject only if there is no DNSname entries in the SubjectAltName, whether or not there is an IpAddress is present.

Also related feedback on current docs:

- https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-usage.html#streaming-and-io makes it seem like it's wise to stream 32 bytes at a time by default. The default example should avoid supplying the amount read per chunk without explaining what that does.
- It's not obvious what happens if we abandon reading a response half-way and release the connection. Is this the idiomatic thing to do (is it even possible to reuse the connection at that point?) or should the connection be explicitly closed?

My rationale for these changes are:
- When `RECENT_DATE` was added it was August in 2014 so I figured jumping to 2016 made sense.
- Because this change is coming more than two years after the original `RECENT_DATE` check was added, it should be safe to assume this will not break anyone who's system times fit the original set of rules which would require not more than two-three years difference in system clock time.

The unit test will also make it harder to forget that this value should be updated, hopefully more often than once every two years but I think this is a good compromise, I'm open to suggestions if this should be more/less frequent."

we have [this test case](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/8bf5be6455c43ba57bdc2a2e48a22ba99afd49ff/tests/unit/ssladapter_test.py#L23) in docker-py which I'm assuming ensures that the client uses safe TLS:

```python
try:
    import requests.packages.urllib3 as urllib3
except ImportError:
    import urllib3

ssl_context = urllib3.util.ssl_.create_urllib3_context()

assert ssl_context.options & OP_NO_SSLv3
assert ssl_context.options & OP_NO_SSLv2
assert not ssl_context.options & OP_NO_TLSv1
```

This works in upstream just fine. But in Fedora this started to fail in rawhide (spin with latest upstream packages). Bear in mind, that we try to [unbundle](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/python-requests.git/tree/python-requests.spec#n105) as much as possible in Fedora, so requests is using upstream urllib3, not the bundled one.

And that's where my knowledge ends. This is [the test failure](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/1265 ):

```

I can easily reproduce (python 3, same is happening with python 2)

```python
In [1]: import urllib3

In [2]: c = urllib3.util.ssl_.create_urllib3_context()

In [3]: c.options

- If I provide some override `pool_kwargs` and a new pool doesn't need to be created (the `pool_kwargs` aren't fields in the pool key), they will be ignored. That seems like it will surprise users.
- A huge number of methods grew a new kwarg that gets passed down the chain of function calls, which is a little sad.

I've coordinated with our downstream repackagers, who are not affected by this vulnerability, and with a representative of the Requests team (in this case, myself), who are also not affected by this vulnerability: all of those constituencies are using urllib3 1.16. I have also coordinated with the OpenSSL team.

This patch requires a few more things before it can be merged into the master branch. Specifically, it requires enhancement of our Travis environment to test with OpenSSL 1.1.0. Probably this is most easily done on the OS X builders, which can have Homebrew install the newer OpenSSL version so we can link PyOpenSSL against it.

1009,Chunked uploads do not deduplicate the Host header field.,2016-10-26T08:05:55Z,2016-11-01T08:22:46Z,Contributor Friendly ♥,,,"When using `urlopen` with a headers dictionary that includes the `Host` header, the `Host` header from the user will be preferred to the automatic one added by httplib. This is not true when calling `urlopen` with `chunked=True`, because `request_chunked` does not have the same deduplication logic as `request` does.

We basically need to duplicate [this logic](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/http/client.py#L1236-L1241).

Should be a pretty easy patch if anyone wants a quick contribution win. A test to prove that this doesn't work, followed by the patch to make it work.

1006,Add Windows CI support with AppVeyor,2016-10-24T00:10:59Z,2017-03-31T21:08:12Z,,,,"Recently @Lukasa has added Mac OS support using Travis in order to fully test the new selectors addition.  One of the main projects that requires decent selectors support is the Happy Eyeballs algorithm (RFC 6555) but the algorithm also requires the use of Windows error constants in order to correctly work on all platforms.

I decided to go ahead and use a good template for testing Python with AppVeyor found at: https://github.com/ogrisel/python-appveyor-demo  I've changed it from a primarily Cython-focused project template to a tox-focused project and I've gotten AppVeyor to run all our tests on all our supported Python versions.  This will give us a lot less guessing when implementing or using features that are for platforms that are not available to all maintainers.  I have not tested the codecov section of the code, but I'm sure it's not too far off if at all.  I've already got all tests running. I'm sure this will take a repository owner to fully integrate AppVeyor support.

From my own trial runs, there are a few tests that fail on Windows already, especially in Python 2.6 with many TLS/SSL errors, there is also another test failing on all Python versions.

The 3rd party project requests_mock takes advantage of this by passing in a StringIO instance as the body (see: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/requests-mock/tree/requests_mock/response.py#n166 ). With the addition of chunked streaming in https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/commit/f21c2a2b73e4256ba2787f8470dbee6872987d2d stream() now assumes for chunked responses that if body is file-like then it is httplib.HTTPResponse-like breaking requests_mock.

This patch adds a guard in stream() to fall back to the old behaviour (delegate to the underlying file-like object as for unchunked responses) and another one to read_chunked() (fail early with an explicit error message).

Please let me know if there's any improvements I should make to get this merged or if you think this fix belongs elsewhere.

Previously negative values raised `InvalidHeader`, now they get truncated to 0. Previously + prefixed values raised `InvalidHeader`, now they are accepted and the + ignored.

# Overview

I'm seeing an `InvalidCodepoint` exception connecting to my elasticsearch server via ssl after upgrading to urllib3==1.17.  This worked correctly with urllib3=1.16.  

What can I do to help debug this issue?  Can I turn up logging? ~~Is this a problem with how elasticsearch is calling urllib3?~~  I've simplified with a direct urllib3 example.
## Lemma 1.

In 1.17 urllib3 switched to using idna.
## Lemma 2

The host has a wildcard certificate valid for `*.prod.example.com` 
## Hypothesis

I assume the wildcard certificate is somehow related to the `u'*'` in the invalid code point error provided from idna.
# Reproduction Steps
## Failing elasticsearch script

urllib3_test.py:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import certifi
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl

host = u""rdb-test-andrew-01.prod.example.com""

"
977,HTTPResponse.closed consistency,2016-09-11T16:19:07Z,2016-09-13T09:04:16Z,,,,"I spent a while yesterday trying to figure out why responses were hitting logic requiring the file to be closed while still evaluating to `closed=False`. There's currently an inconsistency in how urllib3 handles closed responses and part of that is due to #929.

First off, I guess we need to clarify what ""closed"" means for the HTTPResponse. Does it mean the content has all been read, or that we've closed the file pointer? Perhaps it's both and we should be marking the response closed when all the content is read?
## Background

Right now, we have two separate variables `isclosed` (Python 2&3) and `closed` (Python 3) on Python's `HTTPResponse` object. They both behave differently in what determines their boolean value. `isclosed` is defined by the `HTTPResponse`, whether that be in `httplib` (Python 2) or `http.client` (Python 3), while `closed` is defined by the `io` module that `http.client.HTTPResponse` inherits from in Python 3.

`isclosed` checks if the file pointer's content is `None` while the `io` module's `closed` attr only evaluates to True when set. This means we can read all of the bytes off the HTTPResponse object but still have an ""open"" file pointer with a length of 0 when using `io`'s `closed` attr. This won't change until `close()` is called on the file pointer,  but since Python 2 doesn't have a `closed` attr it drops through the first check in urllib3's `closed` method an evaluates as currently expected. Perhaps it's the Python 2 logic that's flawed though, and we shouldn't be leaving cleanup to the GC (assuming the response is ever dereferenced).

I put together 69018f7 to address the issue but didn't open the PR immediately because of the GC question and a side effect with urllib3's `close` method. Moving `isclosed` to a higher preference than `closed` causes `close` to no longer actually close the file pointer as it previously did in Python3. We can obviously implement something to address this but I wanted to get another pair of eyes on this before moving forward.
## Example

This is a quick demo for Python 3 with the current master branch, as is the test included in the PR:

``` python
from urllib3.connectionpool import HTTPConnectionPool
from urllib3.util.response import is_fp_closed

conn = HTTPConnectionPool('stackoverflow.com', maxsize=10)
get_response = conn.request('GET', url='/', preload_content=False)
data = [chunk for chunk in get_response.stream(1024)]
print(is_fp_closed(get_response._fp), get_response.closed)

956,WIP: Handle Redirects in the PoolManager and Normalize URLs during redirects,2016-08-21T17:00:27Z,,,,,"This could probably be two PRs, but they're deeply related in my mind so I'm starting by keeping the pieces of work together. I'll happily pull 2176c26 into its on PR if you want.

That said, I'm starting this WIP now because the previous implementation of Url was _not_ rfc3986 compliant and I'm not sure if we want to keep that behaviour and if people are actually relying on it. Specifically doing

``` py
from urllib3.util.url import parse_url

url = parse_url('google.com:80/foo')
```

Would give you an instance of `Url` where `url.hostname == 'google.com'`. [Section 3 of RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3) however points out that you can only determine the authority (in which the hostname is contained) if it starts with `//`, e.g., a valid URI would be `//google.com:80` not `google.com:80`. So when `rfc3986.urlparse` sees this input, it (correctly per the RFC) parses that differently than `parse_url` used to.

Presently, we even have tests that assert this behaviour. Is this something anyone can rely on? As I understand it, you can't pass a URL without a scheme and hostname. I'm wondering what we needed this for.

I hate removing tests, but I think these should be removed. Thoughts @Lukasa @haikuginger ?

949,Add `enforce_content_length` for responses,2016-08-17T18:56:19Z,2016-08-29T01:28:20Z,,Notes,Notes:,"So here's a pass at #723. This is kind of a weird edge case but it particularly prominent in the default configuration of Requests. Most calls performed by `urllib3` will raise a `IncompleteRead` error from `httplib` when the number of bytes in the body doesn't match the `Content-Length`. 
# The Skinny

`httplib` raises `IncompleteRead`s appropriately everywhere except on incrementally read data. This is the primary way Requests uses `urlopen` with `preload_content=False` and then reading with `iter_content()`. Retrieving data this way hits the flaw in `httplib`. I've added a flag to enable this functionality, so as not to break `stream(amt)` and `read(amt)` calls presently. In the next major release, I would advise the flag being removed to make all `read` operations uniform by default.

Notes:
- My unfamiliarity with the testing harness is definitely showing in `test_strict_content_length` but the test does prove the changes are working correctly. Tornado won't allow you to send uneven data, so this was the only other solution I could come up with. Any suggestions on alternative methods of simulating this problem would be appreciated.
- ~~I implemented `length` as a property to match the attribute nature of `httplib.HTTPResponse.length`. I realize an int that we modify may be preferred to a property, but felt it would be more likely to break if we implement int updates everywhere IO might happen in the code.~~

@jamesls did the detective work [here](https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/1007#issuecomment-240184362), but essentially it boils down to that if you have an 'ssl.py' in your project, then this:

```
try:  # Test for SSL features
    import ssl
    from ssl import wrap_socket, CERT_NONE, PROTOCOL_SSLv23
    from ssl import HAS_SNI  # Has SNI?
except ImportError:
    pass
```

will cascade to this:

```
    if isinstance(candidate, str):
        res = getattr(ssl, candidate, None)
        if res is None:
            res = getattr(ssl, 'CERT_' + candidate)
        return res
```

having `res` equal to `CERT_CERT_REQUIRED`, which obviously isn't correct. 

Obviously this isn't a critical problem, but it was pretty cryptic and imagine that there are a fair few projects that use urllib3 which may have an ssl.py who may bump into this, so perhaps you could make this more graceful.

947,Add support for ChaCha20.,2016-08-15T13:08:28Z,2016-08-15T15:26:12Z,,,,"ChaCha20 is coming in OpenSSL 1.1.0, and it's generally pretty excellent. OpenSSL kindly ignores requests for ciphers that it doesn't support, so we can unconditionally update our code to request ChaCha20 and expect OpenSSL to just quietly ignore the change when it doesn't know what ChaCha is.

This change has us prefer AES-GCM over ChaCha20. This decision is made mostly because newer processors have AES-NI hardware acceleration instructions, and right now we're not in a good place to query whether or not those instructions are present, so we just assume that they are. However, [CPython issue 27766](https://bugs.python.org/issue27766), in addition to making this change, also provides a private function that could be queried for AES-NI support. We may want to wait until CPython 3.6 drops to see if that function makes it in, because we could use it to be smarter about our cipher string.

The idea is that in windows domains the proxy may require authentication using the same credentials as for the user to log on to their workstation. SSPI is the interface which allows application software to utilise the operating system log-on credentials (e.g. for NTLM authentication). This tends to be more secure and convenient than prompting the user for a password (like basic authentication), and is used automatically by applications like chrome and firefox.

There is a race condition however that leads urllib3 to receive a TCP RST and subsequently raise an exception:
1) we have established persistent connection between urllib3 and a server that already had a few successful requests exchange
2) urllib3 sends a new request
3) the http server decides to expire that connection
4) the kernel of the server received the new request
5) the http server closes the socket
6) the kernel sends out a RST
7) urllib3 raises an exception instead of opening a new connection

The OS of the server sends out a RST (instead of FIN) because there is unread data in the buffer of socket. The data was unread because by the time it was received the http server had already expired the connection, but had not closed the socket yet.

See example here:

This PR changes that logic to use cryptography instead. Because PyOpenSSL already depends on cryptography, this has the effect of reducing our actual dependency graph. We still, at a top level, have three dependencies (annoyingly we need `idna`, blame @reaperhulk), but those three top-level dependencies are _already present_ in our dependency graph transitively (`pyopenssl` requires `cryptography` requires `idna`), so this has the effect of reducing the number of packages we rely on directly.

This occurs [here](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/response.py#L361-L365) because `is_fp_closed` won't evaluate to `True` in certain cases. The below test provided by @Lukasa shows the issue in our current implementation of `is_fp_closed`. Currently, in Python 3,  `_close_conn` does not call `super().close()`, which means that the `closed` attribute will never be set. We can fix this by checking `isclosed()` first, if it exists, which will appropriately evaluate to True when the contents of the stream have been completely read.

This is a complex and substantial change, and I'd like a lot of feedback from the other reviewers, as well as @shazow. There are several possible options for supporting this, and this PR is the most radical of the set. However, we may not want to commit to going this far: several of the partial solutions may provide enough value to be worthwhile.

The effect of this pull request is to ensure that, on all Python versions, IP addresses in the subject alternative name field of a TLS certificate can be used to validate the certificate. This is a stark improvement over the status quo, where this only works on Python 3.5 out-of-the-box. However, to achieve it we need to make the following changes:
- backport a newer copy of match_hostname from Python 3.5
- backport and vendor the ipaddress module
- adjust the backported copy of match_hostname to use our vendored copy of ipaddress if it can't find a proper one
- prefer our backported copy of match_hostname to the versions available in Python 2.7.9 through Python 3.4

This is pretty sweeping: in general we've aimed to use as much of the infrastructure that was present in Python as we could, but this change removes that again. It also means that we have not just backported modules but, in the case of match_hostname, are now carrying our patches to it (albeit [only a small one](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/commit/704fcac89cb0026a290228013ccedbe8795c3f97)).

We could also do the following, less extensive things. In order from smallest to largest:
1. Change our logic to prefer the external match_hostname module from PyPI over the installed version on Python < 3.5, and then add `backports.ssl_match_hostname` and `ipaddress` to the `secure` extra.
2. Do 1, but also do a backport of the newer `match_hostname`. Don't backport `ipaddress`. This means that we still need people to install `ipaddress` to get the IP SANs, but means we don't have to vendor that 2k LoC module.
3. Do what I've done here.

I'm very much interested in what people think here. The version I've done is the most complete and has the effect of ""just working"" in all cases, but is also a really substantial change. I'd be interested in seeing people's opinions as to which of these approaches they like best.

One other note: because we're vendoring new packages, we probably need to alert any downstream Linux distributors because they may want to pull these packages out and make them hard dependencies instead. Do we know who our downstream repackagers are for urllib3?

When using urllib3 to connect to https endpoints with certs signed for an IP address (instead of a hostname), urllib throws an error like this:

```
SSLError: hostname '10.3.240.1' doesn't match either of 'kubernetes', 'kubernetes.default', 'kubernetes.default.svc', 'kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local'
```

The problem appears to be that https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/packages/ssl_match_hostname/__init__.py uses the standard library implementation of `match_hostname` for Python versions >= 3.2, but that function only gained support for IP subjects in 3.5.

The fallback in that file is to use `backports.ssl_match_hostname`, which _does_ support IP subjects, as it backports 3.5's implementation.

Any chance we can fix urllib3 to use the backports version for Python versions < 3.5? Or perhaps just to preferentially take the backports version over the standard library version if backports is available? 

This issue is causing problems in downstream libraries, e.g. https://github.com/kelproject/pykube/issues/29, which can be resolved with monkey-patching, but the correct fix appears to be in urllib3.

Printing `dir(self)` from `urllib3/util/retry.py` on line 294 gives this output:

Strangely `history` is not an attribute. Printing `inspect.getfile(self.__class__)` shows the correct retry.pyc file so not sure how the `Retry` class is missing the `history` attribute. When opening the source version of retry.pyc, the `Retry` class has history defined in `__init__`, so I'm stumped.

Even though requests is using an old urllib3 version, the urllib3 above is the current master version.

as a key for various dictionaries, and oddly-cased schemes can break
this. This patch modifies the Url class to normalize both the scheme and
host.

I'm taking a 3-6mo hiatus from urllib3. That is, if everything is happy at 3mo I will probably continue for 6mo, until January 1, 2017 **[update: continuing further with quarterly evaluations]**. Logistically this means I will mute Github urllib3 notifications and forego day-to-day involvement, but I'm still reachable if there are questions or I can be helpful in specific situations.

@lukasa will be taking on responsibility as lead maintainer for the direction of the project in the duration, he will have access to the pypi package and whatever other administrative things are needed. @sigmavirus24 will also be around to help push things forward.

While I'm at it, I want to thank @haikuginger and @jonparrott for choosing to get involved and taking on a lot of big tasks lately. Also @dstufft for making his feedback available as we dig deeper into designing our higher-level APIs. I'm grateful to have you all as collaborators on the project. ✨ :custard: :sparkles:

I look forward to seeing exciting changes when I'm back, maybe then will be a good time to start a strong sprint towards v2.0!

If anyone has questions or concerns, comments here are welcome or email me. ❤️ 

For reference (mostly my own), @Lukasa has urllib3 admin privileges on the following platforms: Github, PyPi, ReadTheDocs."

**Note**:
- I'm not sure we want to fix this case (see the issue).
- I didn't write tests, I just wanted to see if I could work in a fix quickly before work.
- An alternative, that forces people to use `preload_content` and avoids this is to not set `chunked` to `True` when `preload_content` is also `True`. I'm just not sure which behaviour we want.

I notices that urllib3 (and therefore requests) uses RFC-2231 extended attributes when uploading `multipart/form-data` with unicode filenames.

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""file""; filename*=utf-8''%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC.png
```

I wanted to start a discussion in this topic.

A quick test showed that RFC-2231 is not fully supported by `werkzeug`, `cgi.FieldStorage` or`multipart`. I suspect that the majority of server-side parsers for multipart form uploads cannot read these parameters. This is probably because modern browsers don't use this standard. Firefox and chrome simply encode headers with UTF-8 and call it a day.

If we look at Apache HttpClient, arguably the most widely used HTTP client library (which is not a browser) out there, we can find this in the source:

https://github.com/apache/httpclient/blob/trunk/httpclient5/src/main/java/org/apache/hc/client5/http/entity/mime/HttpRFC6532Multipart.java#L37

```
 HttpRFC6532Multipart represents a collection of MIME multipart encoded content bodies,
 implementing the strict (RFC 822, RFC 2045, RFC 2046 compliant) interpretation
 of the spec, with the exception of allowing UTF-8 headers, as per RFC6532.
```

So, Apache HTTPClient also just encodes these headers in UTF-8 and does not use RFC 2231.

I propose dropping RFC-2231 headers in favour of plain UTF-8 headers in the `multipart/form-data` generator of urllib3.

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'Retry' and 'int'

This happened while doing a `pip install` from a `devpi` that was down, causing a `Connection refused` and thus triggering the retry logic of `urllib3`.

YMMV.

892,Planning for breaking changes on TRFKA1.17,2016-06-14T19:53:30Z,,,,,"So, we're taking a step back and considering/refactoring all the breaking changes we want to make in the near future that'll break current API contracts on some level. This issue is basically a dump of my thoughts/plans so far, which are open for discussion to all comers.
- Method of SSL/TLS verification: There's been an interest in having platform-independent hostname verification pre-enabled for `SessionManager`. From talking to @Lukasa, there are two main ways to go about this - first, to either import or package certifi, or to require PyOpenSSL, certitude, and other binary packages to be able to reliably use the platform cert bundles. At this point, certifi is a more practical option, so we basically need to decide if we want to bundle it or require it.
- Scope of SSL/TLS verification: @shazow has indicated that he'd like autoconfig on `SessionManager`, as a high-level configuration object. Personally, I think that if we're putting in the effort to set up a secure default, all of our connection levels should be able to benefit from it - including `ConnectionPool` and `PoolManager`. This is up for discussion, and brings us to...
- Settings handling in general: I'd like to unify all sorts of autoconfiguration code onto a `Settings` object that can be passed into any `RequestMethods` subclass. This would include things like the `SSLContext` to be used, any platform-specific flags that need to be considered (e.g., GAE), or anything else. My vision would be to have any newly-created `Settings` object carry smart defaults, and any newly-created `RequestMethods` subclass get either a `Settings` object in arguments or one of a fresh instantiation of same or a link to a `urllib3`-wide `Settings` object. It'd look something like this:

``` python
import urllib3

# We can call like this...
sm = urllib3.SessionManager()

# Or like this...
insecure_settings = urllib3.Settings(verify_ssl=False)
sm = urlib3.SessionManager(settings=dumb_settings)

# Or you could even do this!
class InsecurePoolManager(urllib3.PoolManager):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        insecure_settings = Settings(verify_ssl=False)
        kwargs[settings] = insecure_settings
        super(InsecurePoolManager, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
```
- While we're on `RequestMethods`, support will be added for explicitly-passed params and body fields. (#885)
- SessionManager will get a rewrite to be more flexible in general. The class will have a default list of `ContextHandlers`, which at first will include just `CookieHandler`, but when instantiating or subclassing `SessionManager`, an alternate list can be provided. Each request/response pair will be passed to each handler in the list for mutation and data extraction. And we're going to include a bonus `BasicAuthHandler` that people can use if they want. This will also solve for #888, as a list without a CookieHandler can be passed to `__init__()`.

``` python
import urllib3
from urllib3.context_handlers import CookieHandler, BasicAuthHandler

basic_auth = BasicAuthHandler('mysite.com', 'username', 'password')
cookies = CookieHandler()
handlers = [cookies, basic_auth]
sm = urllib3.SessionManager(handlers=handlers)
```
- I think I'm going to cut the link between our `Request` object and `urllib.request.Request`. We'll mimic some small features of the interface so that cookielib can still handle our version, but the main goal will be to have data stored in a way that we can natively expand into `urlopen()`. This will also make for a cleaner API for additional `ContextHandlers` to work with.

(Unless we feel that SessionManager is the wrong place for the autoconfigured functionality, then we need yet another layer.)

To be clear, these disabling/enabling should happen during instantiation, not after. Perhaps another fun opportunity to use `False` as a semantic value. :P

885,Expand RequestMethods optional arguments,2016-06-02T00:54:02Z,,,,,"I've come across at least one example of an API where I need to both POST a body of some form and also have query parameters on a request, and this is something I'm accommodated so far in my [beekeeper](https://github.com/haikuginger/beekeeper) project - largely because I've been handling setting those items up in my own code.

I'm now migrating that to urllib3, and one snag I'm seeing is that `RequestMethods.request()` takes a single `fields` argument that turns into either a querystring or `x-www-urlencoded` depending on method- as far as I can tell, there's no way to choose to pass either one or the other explicitly.

Would there be any objection to expanding the `request()` signature to enable those items to be passed explicitly? The way I'm conceiving of it, `fields` would still be encoded according to the request method, while the type-specific arguments (`params` and `form`? Dunno - suggestions welcome) would always be added to the request in their specified format.

If this isn't an appropriate extension, it's not a big deal - I can keep doing it in my own code.

Would be great to have someone (ahem, @jonparrott kinda just volunteered) go through and re-organize and write some more narratives.

Some tasks:
- [x] Make sure the full TOC is available on the landing page (currently not, ugh! we have a bunch of sections that are effectively hidden.)
- [x] Clean up the landing page to de-emphasize lower-level components and talk about the primary flow more (and make sure examples are as much default-secure as we can).
- [x] Clarify areas of the docs which are higher-level vs lower-level stuff (aka not for beginners). Somekind of colourcoding would be ideal but not sure how easy this would be with Sphinx.
- [x] Reduce emphasis that urllib3 is for ""lower level"" stuff—it's not _just_ for lower-level stuff. This has been scaring some beginners.
- [x] Recipes section for different usecases
  - [x] appengine
  - [x] request with a body/json blob
  - [x] streaming to/from file (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27387783/how-to-download-a-file-with-urllib3)
  - [x] custom tls stuff
  - other things?
- [x] Make sure README is reasonably sync'd with what our latest docs say.

883,Drop Python 2 support,2016-05-31T13:55:55Z,,Someday,,,"I'm wondering whether we should start a conversation with our biggest partners (pip, Requests, et. al.) around what the long-term plan for Python 2 ought to be.

The platform itself is planned to have no further support after 2020, so we should probably have a transition plan laid out well in advance so that we can start providing notification and documentation to our users.

Obviously, what that plan ought to be, or even whether we should start considering it yet, is up for discussion.

880,Add typing to __init__ and _collections,2016-05-26T08:58:53Z,,,,,"So, here is a first iteration of adding types checking, as discuted in #867.

Having stubs files was harder to make it works, and in general, it would be best to keep related code and typing. So we will use magic comment as proposed by @sigmavirus24.

There is a bunch of TODO in code, with the corresponding bug report (or general issue).

I'll add some commit comments to explain choices made.

With the current state of mypy, there is a bunch of error, like

```
urllib3/_collections.py:22: error: Name 'OrderedDict' already defined
urllib3/_collections.py:27: error: Name 'RLock' already defined
urllib3/_collections.py:25: error: Name 'RLock' already defined
```

which are caused by mypy not handling conditionals, but, by avoiding theses paths while coding, we can have some type error remarks.

Overview
- add types to `urllib3/__init__.py` and `urllib3/_collections.py`
- adding `urllib3.util.typing` module to allow handling both python2 and python3 with an easier interface. We will add some classes during next iterations
- changing some import check based on `ImportError` to one using `sys.version_info`, as it is the recommanded way to do it in PEP 484

878,urllib3 does not provide a way to send full chain-of-trust when server makes a CertificateRequest ,2016-05-24T14:48:15Z,,,requests.exceptions.SSLError,requests.exceptions.SSLError: Errno bad handshake,"I am on python2.7 installed on CentOS 6. I have OpenSSL 1.0.1e. I have requests version 2.9.1. The HTTP server is performing SSL client authentication. The client's chain has a verification depth of 2, which means there's a single intermediate CA certificate in the client chain. I am not sure if this is a bug or a feature request.

Based on the public api, I sent a request in like so. note i have explicitly chosen not to verify the server's chain of trust (i know that's not secure but this isn't being used in production). The cert.pem contains the client's PEM-encoded certificate, the intermediate CA cert, and the root cert. The final entity in the cert.pem is the client's private key (which is NOT encrypted).

resp = requests.get(url,verify=False,cert='cert.pem')

The following exception is thrown.

requests.exceptions.SSLError: Errno bad handshake

Looking at the server's ssl logs, I can see that the reason the server terminated the SSL connection was caused by the server's inability to construct the client's chain-of-trust. The server could not do this because the request's library only sent its client cert in it. I used openssl s_server to verify this as well.

I could not find anything in the official documentation that would allow me to specify a set of certs to be included in the client's chain-of-trust.

Looking at the pyopenssl wrapper used by requests, I can see the Context.use_certificate method, which sets the leaf cert. I am suspecting that only sets a single certificate. I suspect that for this to work, the requests external api would need to provide an interface for passing in a list of PEM-encoded certs, which is then set via the Context.add_extra_chain_cert method.

868,SessionManager: Provide default instance?,2016-05-20T20:16:35Z,,,,,"This is more thinking ahead and depends on #849 but something I want to discuss:

Would be nice if users could do:

``` python
from urllib3 import http # or maybe `session` or `default` or something?

r= http.request('GET', whatever)
```

Two questions:
1. Is it _safe_ to provide a default instance (or magic property) of SessionManager for people to use?
   Need to consider single-threaded, multi-threaded, and possibly multi-process (this actually might be _more_ safe in a multi-process environment than our current approach where people might accidentally re-use a late-instantiated pool).
2. What should it be named?
   I like using `http` in all of the examples like `http = PoolManager()`, `http = ConnectionPool()` etc., so `http` feels natural to me as a default instance you make http requests through, but I'm open to other ideas.
   Originally, we used to use `pool = PoolManager()` but I think `http` is more friendly in practice.

Remove the TypeError from the exception chain in Python 3; otherwise it
looks like a programming error was the cause. A quick google search of
the above phrase shows I was not the only one.

Here is how a connection timeout looks like before this patch:

```
urllib3.PoolManager().request('GET', 'google.com:81', retries=False, timeout=1)

Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""/home/ran/src/urllib3/urllib3/connectionpool.py"", line 385, in _make_request
    httplib_response = conn.getresponse(buffering=True)

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):

    return self._sock.recv_into(b)

```

After, the first part is gone, and only the real cause is shown.

In Python2, exceptions are not chained automatically so there is no
difference.

859,Consider replacing urlparse with something that can handle the WHATWG's 'generous' definition of a URL.,2016-05-11T12:15:20Z,,,,,"For basically its entire lifetime, urllib3 has used urlparse and friends from the standard library to handle the task of working with URLs.

However, it has recently been pointed out that the WHATWG maintains a URL specification that its proponents claim is merely a codification of common browser practice. That URL specification contains a parsing section that is _dramatically_ more generous than urlparse and friends are: for example, it allows the scheme to be separated from the authority portion of the URL by a colon followed by _at least_ two slashes (allowing for the possibility of having an unbounded amount of slashes: @bagder's testing has found that Firefox will handle a string like `'http:' + ('/' * 8000) + 'example.com'` without complaint).

Given this remarkably expansive definition of the allowed format of a URL, and given that this apparently _really does happen_ on the web, and given also that the position of the WHATWG is that this generosity of parsing is a net good, we should at least consider adopting that parser.

It may be sensible to for us to write a standalone library (as part of the hyper project, perhaps) that is then vendored into urllib3/requests as appropriate. Regardless, we should discuss whether we want to do this or whether we think we should be less lenient.

At first, I thought this issue was a result of #717, but that issue has been resolved in the version of requests I am using. After further research, I landed on this comment in an [SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20715438/89342)

> OpenSSL has very strict requirements about how writes can be retried -- specifically the buffer's address and contents must not be changed. **When you retry a write, you must retry with the _exact_ same buffer (the same contents are not sufficient and, of course, different contents is absolutely prohibited)**.

Using this clue, I added some print statements to `urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl#_send_until_done` and `OpenSSL.SSL#send`:

        while total_sent < len(data):

After running this code, I realized that what was occurring was that a specific buffered subset of my data was being retried, BUT, the memory address of the buffered data was changing because of the call to `buf = _text_to_bytes_and_warn(""buf"", buf)` in `OpenSSL.SSL#send`. Here is the output I received:

```
_send_until_done
no loop
0x10a2bba20
loop
0x10a2bba20
0x7fdd6585f400


loop
0x10a2bba20
0x7fdd638f3000
```

As you can see in that output, the buffer of data in `urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl#_send_until_done` is correctly retried when a failure occurred and it has the correct memory address (`0x10a2bba20`), however, on the second attempt, the memory address of the buffer in `OpenSSL.SSL#send` is different between the two attempts (`0x7fdd6585f400` and `0x7fdd638f3000`).

Considering this, it looks like the use of [`OpenSSL.SSL#send`](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/blob/master/src/OpenSSL/SSL.py#L1259) is the incorrect API to use in `urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl#sendall`. A potential solution is to instead use  [`OpenSSL.SSL#sendall`](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/blob/master/src/OpenSSL/SSL.py#L1285-L1313), which seems to account for large requests by performing the [chunking of data](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/blob/master/src/OpenSSL/SSL.py#L1305-L1313) _after_ [`_text_to_bytes_and_warn`](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/blob/master/src/OpenSSL/SSL.py#L1296) has been executed.

The last Retry object of the request is added to the response object. Thus allowing the user to check if any errors occurred during the request. In addition to give more information to the user the Retry object now has a history attribute. This attribute contains a list of the errors that were thrown at each connection retry.

example code:

```
retry = Retry(total=2)
resp = pool.request('GET', '/', retries=retry)

That isn't consistent with the actual behavior on the first retry, as when `_observed_errors == 1` the sleep function returns 0, so there is no wait after the first retry. This behavior is specifically covered by a unit test requiring the first sleep to return 0. According to the actual behavior, the documentation should read ""[0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries."", and probably also note that there is no wait after the first retry.

I'm not sure what the intended behavior is, or what it should be in principle. My vote would be for a wait after the first retry, and I would be happy to contribute a quick fix in either case.

843,Support cookies when the PoolManager or ConnectionPool is passed a CookieJar object,2016-04-13T18:45:09Z,,,,,"I think I can support cookie handling with the stdlib `CookieJar` object without too much trouble, and wanted to get some thoughts on implementation first.

The biggest change is that both `CookieJar.extract_cookies` and `CookieJar.add_cookie_header` both expect to work with a `urllib.request.Request`-like object. We can work around this by temporarily loading basic request information (essentially URL) into the appropriate object and then pull the modifications back out, but if we're doing that, it may also be worthwhile to consider a `urllib3.request.Request` object that can be passed around like `urllib.request.Request`.

The second, more minor, change is that `CookieJar.extract_cookies` expects an `info()` method on the response which returns response headers. Given that there's an existing urllib3 header API, for this case, I'd rather just build a disposable shim to give `CookieJar` what it needs.

Regardless, thoughts are appreciated on two questions: is this an appropriate feature for urllib3 to support, and if so, is using the stdlib to this extent an appropriate way to implement it?

It is easy to use the Mozilla-provided certifications for HTTPS validation. However these certificates may vary from the OS-native certificates. In such a case, urllib3 might fail to fetch a URL that a native browser app would succeed in fetching. This behavior is confusing to the user.

I propose adding an easy-to-use function to urllib3 that attempts to find the OS-native certificates automatically, so they can then be used for HTTPS validation. Something to automate the platform-specific certificate search alluded to from the StackOverflow post linked from the documentation link above.

> HTTP conflates the identification of resources with their location.  In other words, ""http://"" and ""https://"" URIs are used to both name and find things to interact with.
> 
> In some cases, it is desirable to separate identification and location in HTTP; keeping the same identifier for a resource, but interacting with it at a different location on the network.
> 
> For example:
> - An origin server might wish to redirect a client to a different server when it is under load, or it has found a server in a location that is more local to the client.
> - An origin server might wish to offer access to its resources using a new protocol, such as HTTP/2, or one using improved security, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).
> - An origin server might wish to segment its clients into groups of capabilities, such as those supporting Server Name Indication (SNI), for operational purposes.
> 
> This specification defines a new concept in HTTP, ""Alternative Services"", that allows an origin server to nominate additional means of interacting with it on the network.

The main interest I have in this specification is that it's likely to be the building block for HTTP Opportunistic Encryption, which I'd very much like urllib3 to support.

In the short term I don't expect anyone to pick this work up: it's not an enormously high priority for me right now, certainly. However, I want an issue to track it, as this will allow anyone who wants this feature to put a bounty on it to get the work done.

The differences between this PR and the original are:
- The tests pass! The original PR had failing tests, and was written at a time when we didn't test PyOpenSSL at all so those tests failed _miserably_. This patch brings everything up to speed.
- Adds PyOpenSSL support, including a new wrapper context object for PyOpenSSL that has a similar interface to the builtin context. The goal here is to keep the experience the same for users who are using PyOpenSSL contexts. As a side benefit, this now allows users to use both PyOpenSSL and the standard library SSL module at the same time if they so choose (by passing appropriate context objects).
- Refactors the code to continue to use as much of the original code as possible. @sigmavirus24 had hoisted a lot of code out of `urllib3.util.ssl_.ssl_wrap_socket`, but that method now takes a `context` argument, which means that we really should just re-use it. This patch has been adjusted to do that, ensuring that code coverage remains high and that logic exists in as few places as possible.

If @sigmavirus24 is happy to agree to it, I'd say that this patch supersedes #507.

The biggest problem is in the ProxyManager, where `connection_from_host` will incorrectly treat any HTTPS scheme with a capital letter in it like a HTTP connection (which isn't great), but the flaw is pretty common elsewhere in those objects (e.g. an uppercased host will get a different connection pool to a lowercased host).

At the very minimum we should be using a lowercased scheme at all points in the urllib3 stack. We should also consider whether we want to be case-sensitive about domains (I'm inclined to say that we do not).

by itself is not much info to go on. It would be nice to see the server certificate that was presented.

I found that it was surprisingly difficult to see the server certificate, so I decided to see if urllib3 could show the certificate.

With this, urllib3 logs an error with the certificate just before raising the exception:

```
ERROR:requests.packages.urllib3.connection:Certificate did not match expected hostname: 10.10.194.38.
Certificate: {'subjectAltName': (('IP Address', '127.0.0.1'), ('IP Address', '10.10.194.36'), ('IP Address', '10.10.194.37'), ('IP Address', '10.10.194.38')),

'subject': ((('countryName', u'US'),), (('stateOrProvinceName', u'California'),), (('localityName', u'Palo Alto'),), (('organizationName', u'DevOps'),), (('commonName', u'vault
```

which allows me to check whether the server is presenting the correct certificate.

I also add the certificate to the exception that is raised so that client code can inspect it.

814,"parse_url fails when given credentials in the URL with '/', '#', or '?'",2016-03-15T15:10:48Z,2016-03-16T12:08:16Z,,,,"Technically, this behavior is compliant with RFC-3986 in that the ""authority"" section should end at the next instance of one of those characters. However, RFC-2617, which specifies the HTTP Basic Auth scheme, does not specifically exclude those characters as valid, which means that there are valid RFC-2617 usernames and passwords which cannot currently be transmitted inside the URL for handling.

This behavior has received an issue filing on pip in the context of an HTTP proxy.

The attached pull request changes behavior such that any authorization information (separated from the rest of the URL by the reserved character '@') is pulled from the URL prior to scanning for the end of the authority section (separated from the rest of the URL by the aforementioned reserved characters). The PR also includes regression tests to ensure that this behavior change stays in place.

``` python
from gevent import monkey, spawn, sleep, Timeout, joinall
monkey.patch_all()

import sys
from itertools import product
from urllib3.connectionpool import HTTPConnectionPool

def timed_read(cp, i, timeout, release=None, preload_content=True):

        with Timeout(timeout):

        print ""poolsize decreased: %s"" % current_size


for timeout, preload in product([10, 4, 0.1], [True, False]):
    main(timeout=timeout, preload=preload)
```

Setting a timeout that way may seem stupid, as it could be set on the connection itself, but it's just an example for having a timeout running on a longer running task including several calls into the connection pool. What happens is, that the connections are not properly returned back into the queue, and the queue finally runs empty, and any further call to it blocks forever:

<pre>
----------  timeout=10 preload=True release=None ----------
1 opened
1 finished
0 opened
0 finished
2 opened
2 finished
----------  timeout=10 preload=False release=None ----------
0 opened
0 finished
1 opened
1 finished
2 opened
2 finished
----------  timeout=4 preload=True release=None ----------
1 opened
1 finished
0 timed out
2 timed out
----------  timeout=4 preload=False release=None ----------
1 opened
1 finished
0 opened
0 finished
2 timed out
poolsize decreased: 1
----------  timeout=0.1 preload=True release=None ----------
0 timed out
1 timed out
2 timed out
----------  timeout=0.1 preload=False release=None ----------
0 timed out
1 timed out
2 timed out
poolsize decreased: 0
</pre>


Simply setting `preload_content` to `True` is not an option, as e.g. `False` is set by default by requests.

The main problem is in https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/response.py#L246 . The `Timeout` does not derive from `Exception`, so `self._original_response` is not closed in the except clause, and therefore the connection is not released in the finally clause.

This change makes it possible to trust the system certificate store explicitly on systems that would like to. The goal is to have this be a cross-platform way to solve the problem, so that Windows and OS X aren't left out in the cold in this kind of world. The goal here is to divide the world into two sets of users:
- Non-Windows and Non-OS X users. These users are assumed to be using OpenSSL, configured appropriately, such that `set_default_verify_paths` will work correctly for them. In that instance, if `trust_system` is `True`, they will automatically use OpenSSL with the system cert stores.
- Windows and OS X users. These users cannot use `set_default_verify_paths` because those platforms have their own, complex, certificate stores that do not and cannot interface properly with OpenSSL. These platforms will therefore need to use certitude to validate their trust stores: essentially, they'll pass the X509 cert chain to certitude which will call into the relevant system functions to do the validation.

This is very much WIP right now, and there are the following limitations:
1. We need to bikeshed the API a bit.
2. This has made `ssl_wrap_socket` a bit crazy: we may want to factor it out a bit to keep the code cleaner.
3. certitude doesn't work on Windows yet.

However, feedback would be appreciated.

799,Changes to support sending a complete response object when 407 errors…,2016-02-04T12:01:16Z,,,,,"… is found while doing the CONNECT to proxy. Added a way to stablish a connection using connect over an already connected socket

Trying to connect to a ""https"" web page using a proxy uses a ""HTTP CONNECT"" verb to tell the proxy that we want to connect to a https destination.
With ""basic authentication"" the ""CONNECT"" is sent with the appropriate headers so the proxy can authenticate the request and do the request to the https web server. (That headers are setup by the requests library)
With ""NTLM"" we use a plugin (requests-ntlm) that is set as a hook and it is called on every request response. For example: with HTTP, the requests library sends a ""GET"" to a web page, as a response we get a HTTP-407 that is handled by the plugin hook to do the NTLM negotiation and authentication
In a HTTPS scenario, the first connection to the proxy is being done with the ""CONNECT"". At that time, requests does not set any authentication header (because it is handled by a plugin) and we get an 407 authentication Error.

This Patch tries to avoid raising an exception on ""Proxy Authentication"" errors and it sends back a complete http response so it can be handled by the requests-ntlm plugin and reuse an already connected and authenticated socket to do the connection

It also enables testing of the PyOpenSSL code in Python 3, and fixes a few bugs we had that prevented that from functioning properly.

Unfortunately, I had to rewrite the server certificate, because this change revealed that our server certificate would raise warnings under PyOpenSSL because it had no dnsname subject alternative name fields. This didn't affect the standard library because the standard library would also return email fields. This change unfortunately extends the footprint of the total patch quite a bit.

I so far have not enabled code coverage for PyOpenSSL. This is in part because getting accurate numbers for it will be tricky: there's large chunks of code that are specific to error conditions or to individual Python versions that we have not fully investigated. We should investigate how best to obtain code coverage here, which may involve changing our reporting logic to look a bit more like what @hynek suggests [here](https://hynek.me/articles/testing-packaging/).

For the sake of @sigmavirus24 I should also note that this change has a potentially destabilising effect on requests. Previously requests would _not_ automatically use the PyOpenSSL code because the import failed (due to the import of `socket._fileobject`). This change makes that code path functional, which means that Python 3 installations of requests may suddenly take a new and potentially under-tested code path. We'll want to come up with a battle plan here.

While we're there, we should add `TestSSL` to the import from `test_socketlevel`, as the `SSL` tests are probably a good thing to have run under PyOpenSSL as well!

This will give us a hook for writing tests that only run under PyOpenSSL and the expectation that they will actually run on multiple platforms.

You'll get `1` only, since `zlib.decompress` stops decoding at the end of the first gz data.

The proposed fix is feed https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html#zlib.Decompress.unused_data into a new `Decompress` object until no `unused_data` is observed.

The alternative this is pseudo-MITM by the proxy which _can_ be done (see squid ssl_bump) but is quite terrible.

779,HTTPResponse.close may not close underlying connection.,2016-01-09T16:45:02Z,2016-01-14T19:12:57Z,,,,"Found while investigating kennethreitz/requests#2963

The `HTTPResponse` class has a `close` method that rather suggests it will try to close the backing TCP connection behind the given HTTP response. Right now, that's not what happens if the connection is kept alive for any reason (that is, if the server did not send `Connection: close`): instead, the TCP connection will be kept alive and handled as normal.

This seems moderately surprising to me. What it means, in practice, is that calling `HTTPResponse.close()` in both urllib3 and httplib/http.client does not guarantee the closure of the backing TCP connection: instead, in both cases it says ""I'm done with the TCP connection, but the underlying connection is free to re-use it"". The problems this causes can be see in the `_error_catcher` context manager on the HTTPResponse which does not actually call the class `close` method, presumably because it's too deficient to do the job.

This behaviour affects the chunked transfer encoding decoding logic which calls `self.close()` and therefore may incorrectly keep the connection alive, though it does not itself return the connection to the pool.

I believe it _should_ be safe to have `close` close the underlying connection if it is present. As something of an optimisation, we can then safely assume that `close` can call `release_conn`, which will allow us to keep hold of the `HTTPConnection` object in a situation where otherwise we might lose it.

So i doubt this is a bug because I think urllib3 should automatically detect exact ssl version to use or i should detect website's ssl version myself ? And how to do that ? Thank!

776,v2.0 Wishlist,2016-01-05T20:02:09Z,,Someday,,,"Not sure we'll do this, but if we ever get a v2.0 release, some major changes that would be nice to see:
- Deprecate/remove outdated APIs
  - `pool.urlopen(...)` (in favour of consuming a pre-configured request object; the rest of the RequestMethod helpers will probably remain backwards-compatible)
  - `response.data` (in favour of `.read()`)
  - Default `response.read(preload_content=False)` https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues/436
  - (What else am I forgetting?)
- More context managers as a default API! (To allow block-based closing/release, and possibly async-ness) https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues/809
- Request history
  - We'll need a pre-configurable request object (instead of using a few dozen keyword params).
- Autoconfig for AppEngine/Proxy settings/SSL (certifi)/others?
  - We'll need a Session-like class in front of PoolManager that is more implicit. Ideally any new feature we add which can get auto-configured based on env should happen magically here.
- More configurable security?
  - I forget what we were doing for this, I remember we were working on some SSLContext abstraction?
- No exposed dict registries, switch to callables. (Related: #828)
- Return proper types on `.read()` (should this be bytes? or header-sensitive encoding?)
- Unlikely long shots:
  - Get rid of httplib dependence.
    - Add trailing header support (#804)
  - Async by default
  - http/2 support
  - Drop a Python, any Python. (Probably the 2nd Python) #883

775,WIP: Chunked transfer encoding on HTTP requests,2016-01-03T12:40:55Z,2016-01-25T17:16:46Z,"Feedback Pending, Soon",,,"I recently stumbled upon this quite hacky lines in requests: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L380 What happens there is, that requests has to do dirty low level work, to get chunked transfer encoding going on in HTTP requests. This low level hack is fairly untested there (if I didn't miss anything obvious), and doesn't really integrate well with all the proxy stuff etc. going on on higher levels, especially error handling, as many higher levels of urllib3 are just bypassed. 

But it looks like currently there was no better way to do this, as urllib3 does not support any chunked request by itself. The original `httplib.HTTPConnection` is also lacking this feature. So this pull request is basically adding some separate `request_chunked` method on HTTPConnection and exposes this functionality to upstream libraries, i.e. requests, so that it can make use of it in some later version and get rid of the misplaced lowlevel code.

In terms of implementation, it would have probably been more elgant to just add a `chunked` flag to the `HTTPConnection.request` method itself, but I thought it may be better for backwards compatibility, to have a separate function.

For that reason, if @Anorov doesn't change their mind and this submission does qualify for it, I'll donate the bounty, in full, to PyLadies.

This change essentially pulls most of the work done in #692 out into a contrib module. This allows us to avoid having to change too many things in the mainline of urllib3, and also ensures that it is not affected by the requirements to have tests and coverage. This helps us get the work initially off the ground and out into the world.

If we decide to take this change as-is, I'll also volunteer to be ""on the hook"" for supporting it going forward until such time as I can add sufficient test coverage for it.

> That still irks me. The real problem is not tinygram prevention. It's ACK delays, and that stupid fixed timer. They both went into TCP around the same time, but independently. I did tinygram prevention (the Nagle algorithm) and Berkeley did delayed ACKs, both in the early 1980s. The combination of the two is awful. Unfortunately by the time I found about delayed ACKs, I had changed jobs, was out of networking, and doing a product for Autodesk on non-networked PCs.
> Delayed ACKs are a win only in certain circumstances - mostly character echo for Telnet. (When Berkeley installed delayed ACKs, they were doing a lot of Telnet from terminal concentrators in student terminal rooms to host VAX machines doing the work. For that particular situation, it made sense.) The delayed ACK timer is scaled to expected human response time. A delayed ACK is a bet that the other end will reply to what you just sent almost immediately. Except for some RPC protocols, this is unlikely. So the ACK delay mechanism loses the bet, over and over, delaying the ACK, waiting for a packet on which the ACK can be piggybacked, not getting it, and then sending the ACK, delayed. There's nothing in TCP to automatically turn this off. However, Linux (and I think Windows) now have a TCP_QUICKACK socket option. Turn that on unless you have a very unusual application.
> Turning on TCP_NODELAY has similar effects, but can make throughput worse for small writes. If you write a loop which sends just a few bytes (worst case, one byte) to a socket with ""write()"", and the Nagle algorithm is disabled with TCP_NODELAY, each write becomes one IP packet. This increases traffic by a factor of 40, with IP and TCP headers for each payload. Tinygram prevention won't let you send a second packet if you have one in flight, unless you have enough data to fill the maximum sized packet. It accumulates bytes for one round trip time, then sends everything in the queue. That's almost always what you want. If you have TCP_NODELAY set, you need to be much more aware of buffering and flushing issues.
> None of this matters for bulk one-way transfers, which is most HTTP today. (I've never looked at the impact of this on the SSL handshake, where it might matter.)
> Short version: set TCP_QUICKACK. If you find a case where that makes things worse, let me know.

I am calling, from Java (through jython), a python script that uses a 3rd party python API that makes use of urllib3 to call a REST api. This whole setup obviously makes it challenging to troubleshoot issues.
The 3rd party python API we’re using uses urllib3 version 1.12
While I know it would be very useful, I do not have a small sample to replicate the issue (I’d have to peel a lot of layers that I do not have a good understanding of at this point). I might need to work on it if nobody can help me without it.

The issue I am having is thrown by the zlib java implementation that is called by jython:

```

    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:606)
```

The issue seems to be linked to the fact that the flush() method is called on a zlip.decompressobj object but that somehow, somewhere, we’re still trying to call the decompress method on that zlibdecompressobj object.
This is something that the zlib documentation mentions should not be done:
“After calling flush(), the decompress() method cannot be called again; the only realistic action is to delete the object.” (from https://docs.python.org/2/library/zlib.html)

Further debugging took me to the response.py file, in the read_chunked method, especially in the last line of this part:

```
            while True:
                self._update_chunk_length()
                if self.chunk_left == 0:
                    break
                chunk = self._handle_chunk(amt)
                yield self._decode(chunk, decode_content=decode_content,
                                   flush_decoder=True)
```

It looks like when self._decode is called, we always set flush_decoder to True.

Because of this, if I understand correctly, the self._decoder object (which is, in my case, a GzipDecoder, and a decompressobj?) is always flushed at the end of the call to self._decode (line 200).
However, the self._decoder seems to be initialized only once and seems to be reused (at least in my case) throughout the multiple calls to self._decode.

Though I am probably missing a few things, it could explain why decompressobj.decompress is called on a decompressobj object that has been flushed, and this could (?) have unpredictable results, including that NPE in the jython implementation of zlib (and ultimately in java).

Here is a deeper (and sanitized) portion of the call stack when the exception happens.

Is it possible that the _decode method is causing the problem by calling decompress on a decompressobj that has been flushed or am I going down the wrong track?

Note that the problem is gone if I reinitialize the decompressobj at the beginning of _decode by mimicking what _init_decoder does, which I can’t believe is a good fix (although self._decoder seems to be really used only in _decode):

```
        content_encoding = self.headers.get('content-encoding', '').lower()
        self._decoder = _get_decoder(content_encoding)
```

Thanks in advance.

Laurent.

But the set/clear sequence falls on its head if the test thread is not already waiting on `ready_event`.

This patch seems to ensure that the test thread never gets locked out of the `ready_event`.

728,conn.close() can raise OpenSSL exception after idle timeout,2015-10-27T20:06:53Z,2015-10-29T00:20:49Z,,,,"When returning a connection to the pool, urllib3 calls `conn.close()`:

```

            log.info(""Resetting dropped connection: %s"" % self.host)
            conn.close()
```

This can raise an exception under the following conditions:
- urllib3 is using pyOpenSSL and https
- Remote webserver is running Windows IIS (7.5 and 8 tested)
- KeepAlives are active (default for IIS)
- Connection drops after idle timeout

tcpdump shows that the remote IIS host sends a RST on idle timeout. This appears to be IIS-specific behaviour (Apache2 and haproxy both close the connection normally)

At that point nothing bad happens immediately. However the connection remains in the pool. The next time you send a request to this host, it is reused; some data is sent down it; this then raises an `OpenSSL.SSL.SysCallError` exception. I am guessing that it it is trying to send an SSL shutdown message down the already-closed socket.

Basically, there are edge cases where a socket can appear to have closed normally (end-of-file) but was actually reset before sending/receiving all of a response. This may happen silently without raising any exceptions from urllib3.

A suggestion was made to allow users to enable a ""strict transfer-length"" check in urllib3. For what it's worth RFC2616 (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.4) describes when Content-Length should be used by servers. It seems like the chunked logic is probably safe from this, but probably want to confirm that too.

```

A bit of digging revealed #412 and #626 as issues that relate to the relevant code in urllib3. `WrappedSocket.sendall` proxies to `WrappedSocket._send_until_done`, which invokes [`OpenSSL.SSL.send`](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/blob/8adee5e7f8759886678ab83919d5956151e825f3/OpenSSL/SSL.py#L1249) in a loop. The conditions for loop termination are a) the write succeeds or b) a timeout expires while waiting for the socket to become writable in the case of a `WantWriteError`.

I think that this issue boils down to:
1. `WrappedSocket.sendall` converts the data to be sent to a `memoryview`.
2. `WrappedSocket._send_until_done` invokes `OpenSSL.SSL.send` in a loop according to the conditions above.
3. [`OpenSSL.SSL.send` calls the `memoryview.tobytes()`](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/blob/8adee5e7f8759886678ab83919d5956151e825f3/OpenSSL/SSL.py#L1264) and passes the bytestring result in the OpenSSL write call.
4. In the `WantWriteError` case, 2 and 3 are repeated and a _new_ bytestring is passed to the OpenSSL write, resulting in a `SSL3_WRITE_PENDING` error.

I was able to get around this issue by patching `urllib3/contrib/pyopenssl.py` to enforce that a single bytestring is used for all calls to `OpenSSL.SSL.send`: https://gist.github.com/evnm/af92092c6a7776e08339

Please advise on whether this is a good way to fix the issue. I tried adding a test case to `test/with_dummyserver/test_https.py`, but haven't figured out how to tickle the specific issue I've run into.

713,Add optional support for Brotli content-encoding,2015-10-04T15:08:31Z,,,,,"This pull request adds optional support for the [Brotli](http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/introducing-brotli-new-compression.html) compression algorithm used as a content-encoding, alongside the current support for gzip and deflate. Chromium have announced their [intention to implement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/xdVm8c2GOMQ) Brotli, and Firefox 44 included [their support for Brotli](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366559). Curl also [intend to implement Brotli](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/todo.html#More_compressions), but it'd be nice to beat @bagder to the punch for once!

Google claims that Brotli achieves 20%-26% higher compression ratios than other compression algorithms. They claim the reference implementation decodes just as quickly as deflate in zlib, but with denser compression than LZMA and bzip2.

This implementation currently relies on the hyper project's [brotlipy](https://github.com/python-hyper/brotlipy) sub-project, a CFFI-based wrapper around the Brotli reference implementation. For obvious reasons, as this adds a third-party dependency, the proposed enhancement is a `contrib` module.

Right now this contrib module monkeypatches its way into urllib3, but in the act of writing it I couldn't help but notice that we're really not very far from being able to have a 'formal' content-encoding plugin system. If that sounds like something worth having let me know, and I could write it and then refactor this contrib module to be the first user of that system. (On the other hand, it may simply not be worth it!)

In the short term, **I don't think we should merge this** just because I'm having trouble actually finding a site that uses Brotli! I think the best way to handle this is for me to offer an enhancement to httpbin that uses brotlipy to provide a `/brotli` endpoint, but that means I need to sit down and actually write that. That's blocked behind python-hyper/brotlipy#2, but I can hopefully get around to that soonish.

https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/util/ssl_.py#L137

The digests being compared are strings, and `==` is not constant-time, which could potentially allow a timing attack. While it may not immediately be obvious whether an adversary could gain any advantage by successfully timing this line, I am a firm believer in ""better safe than sorry.""

The best way to fix this is to use a constant-time digest comparison function, such as the built-in `hmac.compare_digest`. However, this function was only introduced in Python 2.7.7, while this library supports Python 2.6+. The next best solution would be to use something like the `constant_time_compare` function from the following package:
https://github.com/mitsuhiko/itsdangerous

Using a constant-time comparison is semantically equivalent to using `==`, and the performance impact is negligible and comes along with improved security. I believe this is a good tradeoff.

709,.read should only return empty (false) when there is nothing left to read (EOS),2015-09-18T16:16:58Z,,,,,"I have some code that does a partial read of a ""raw"" response in requests to look for ""magic bytes"".  Digging into the urllib3 code I find that the size you pass in is used as the pre-decode amount which means that the decompressor doesn't have enough bytes to give you anything.  This confused my code into thinking it had read all of the response, which it hadn't.

Here is a simple example:

In [1]: import urllib3
In [2]: http = urllib3.PoolManager()
In [3]: resp = http.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/gzip', preload_content=False)
In [4]: resp.read(8)

I would argue that the amount passed into .read (8 in this case) should be the amount _after_ decoding.

I originally did not include the `preload_content=False`.  This is necessary.  Without it the content is (correctly) loaded into `.data`.

702,Any opinion on a Fedora unbundling question?,2015-09-02T15:15:50Z,,,,,"An [issue was raised](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1231381) in the Fedora bugtracker about handling `ssl_match_hostname` unbundling on Fedora releases that carry Python 2.7.9.  Here's the rundown:
- Currently, we replace the bundled `ssl_match_hostname` shim with a symlink to the system copy of `ssl_match_hostname` (to unbundle).
- In the ticket, Carl points out correctly that we don't need that extra lib/dep on Fedora releases that carry Python 2.7.9, so he wants to remove it.
- In doing so, he's suggesting that we reintroduce some of those import patches that we used to carry.
- Instead, we could replace the bundled `ssl_match_hostname` module with a symlink to the stdlib `ssl` module on Python 2.7.9 systems, and keep the old symlink on older Fedora releases.

How does that sound?  Do you have any opinion on how we do this?  Any different ideas?  Cheers!

Here is an attempt at SOCKS support with the latest version of PySocks. At the moment there are no tests, though I plan to add them, and definitely encourage others to add them and help with them. I've been testing it with a local script so far. The functionality should all work at the moment, but I can't say that with serious confidence until full tests have been added.

I had to choose between peppering ProxyManager with a few if-branches, or subclassing it and making a SOCKSProxyManager. I decided to go with the former, to preserve full backwards compatibility and allow end users to use the familiar `ProxyManager(""socks5://localhost:9050"")` syntax. A way to make it more OO while preserving compatibility would be to add override **new** for ProxyManager and defer to the SOCKSProxyManager class when a SOCKS URL scheme is seen, but it's debatable whether that is more or less Pythonic.

Unfortunately, a pure-Python SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 server may not be feasible for testing, unless someone has one already written. The ones I found on the Internet have various issues. This is why I've held off on comitting anything since then, and frankly didn't want to spend the time hunting around to get a full test suite working. So, test assistance is very much needed.

I am not interested in the bounty, and would like it split between the other contributors.

Related attempts (should be a great reference if anyone wants to tackle this):
- https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/68 (original attempt using socksipy; outdated code)
- https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/284 (another attempt using pysocks—a more up-to-date fork of socksipy; outdated code)
- https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/486 (most recent attempt, refactored version of pysocks attempt)
- https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/692 (another recent attempt, but mixes pysocks logic into the connectionpools)
- https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues/630 (recipe for wrapping pysocks)
- https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/762 (@lukasa)

Suggestions:
- SOCKS proxy support should ideally be built into ProxyManager (or a similar manager if combining is not possible).
- Should use pysocks (unless there's anything newer?). Avoid vendoring if possible, we can enable support when pysocks is installed (also include a `urllib3[socks]` install tag which will pull in the dependency).

To complete this issue, the feature needs to be documented and have full test coverage so that it can be merged into urllib3 core (or at least contrib).

680,Possible KeyError issue with Python 3.6,2015-07-18T19:18:33Z,2015-08-19T06:27:17Z,,KeyError,"KeyError: ('https', 'eu.wiktionary.org', 443)","As Travis is now using Python 3.6 when using `nightly` we had recently build breakage partially due to a `KeyError` raised inside of `urllib3`. Unfortunately I can't provide something simple to reproduce it, as it only happens (for me) when I do a full test run of pywikibot. Whenever I only tested the parts where the error occurred I got nothing. I'll still try to narrow it down and maybe provide a good test example but I figured you know `urllib3` and might be able to either help me narrow it down or can test it on your own.

In 1.10 through 1.10.2, `HTTPResponse.stream()` always called `HTTPResponse.read()`.  This method catches all `httplib.HTTPException` (including `httplib.IncompleteRead`), and re-raises them as
`ProtocolError`.

In 1.10.3 and 1.10.4, `HTTPResponse.stream()` may call `HTTPResponse.read_chunked()` instead. This method may (via the `_update_chunk_length()` helper method) raise `httplib.IncompleteRead`.
This exception will not be caught, and will be raised out of the call to `HTTPResponse.stream()`.

Fix the contract of `HTTPResponse.stream()` by making `HTTPResponse.read_chunked()` catch the same low-level exceptions that `HTTPResponse.read()` catches. This is accomplished by refactoring this
try/except logic into a shared context manager.

Fixes #673.

A project I work on recently upgraded to requests 2.7.0 (which has vendored urllib3 1.10.4), and has started to see crashes because of `IncompleteRead` being raised from `HTTPResponse.stream()`. We previously would catch `RequestException`, as requests would catch `ProtocolError` (but not `IncompleteRead`) and re-raise a `ChunkedEncodingError` in `Response.iter_content()`.

I'm not familiar with `urllib3.util.retry`, but at a glance it also seems like this change would negatively affect the `_is_read_error()` helper method.

On line 93 of requests/adapters.py there is:

response.headers = CaseInsensitiveDict(getattr(resp, 'headers', {}))
```

where resp['headers'] is now of type urllib3.HTTPHeaderDict so the following happens before and after this line is executed:

```
resp['headers'] is

HTTPHeaderDict({'soapserver': 'SOAP::Lite/Perl/1.11', 'x-xss-protection': '1; mode=block', 'x-content-type-options': 'nosniff', 'content-encoding': 'gzip', 'transfer-encoding': 'chunked', 'set-cookie': 'Bugzilla_login_request_cookie=or9UbA03it; domain=bugzilla.redhat.com; path=/; HttpOnly', 'vary': 'Accept-Encoding,User-Agent', 'server': 'Apache', 'connection': 'close', 'date': 'Thu, 09 Jul 2015 15:33:28 GMT', 'x-frame-options': 'SAMEORIGIN', 'content-type': 'text/xml'})

response.headers is 

<class 'requests.structures.CaseInsensitiveDict'> {'soapserver': ('soapserver', 'SOAP::Lite/Perl/1.11'), 'x-xss-protection': ('x-xss-protection', '1; mode=block'), 'x-content-type-options': ('x-content-type-options', 'nosniff'), 'content-encoding': ('content-encoding', 'gzip'), 'transfer-encoding': ('transfer-encoding', 'chunked'), 'set-cookie': ('set-cookie', 'Bugzilla_login_request_cookie=or9UbA03it; domain=bugzilla.redhat.com; path=/; HttpOnly'), 'vary': ('vary', 'Accept-Encoding,User-Agent'), 'server': ('server', 'Apache'), 'connection': ('connection', 'close'), 'date': ('date', 'Thu, 09 Jul 2015 15:33:28 GMT'), 'x-frame-options': ('x-frame-options', 'SAMEORIGIN'), 'content-type': ('content-type', 'text/xml')}
```

then the value for content-type becomes ('content-type', 'text/xml') which breaks elsewhere. 

We can either patch python-request to account for that (I've found one place and it works for me) or better provide a backward compatible update to urllib3.  Any idea if we can make the later ?

659,Connection not returned to pool when streaming and socket error occurs -> pool becomes exhausted,2015-06-26T10:39:21Z,,,,,"When stream=True and reading large files using requests.models.iter_content, which calls urllib3.response.stream -> self.read, if a SocketTimeout error occurs (and presumably BaseSSLError (and possibly HTTPException)) the self._original_response is not closed and therefore the connection is not released. This means that in blocking connection_pool scenarios the pool will eventually become exhausted.

Hi again!
I've tested this and can confirm that this is the case. It's going to be very hard to add a test case in your test suite to reproduce this in your test env. Looking at the code in stream we iterate over calls to read. If an exception is thrown in there and we haven't read all of the content self._original_response.isclosed() will return False, and thus in your finally block (which btw can be moved above the decoding/decompress code) we will not execute the self.release_conn statement.
Presumably, all errors at this point are connection errors so we're not going to be doing any more reading of the response. In your connection handlers you'll need to do a self._original_response.close() so that we release the conn. Here's the fix (sorry, still don't know how to format code):
response.py.215:

```
        except SocketTimeout:
            # FIXME: Ideally we'd like to include the url in the ReadTimeoutError but
            # there is yet no clean way to get at it from this context.
            # the response is not not closed we must do it now to ensure that the
            # connection is released back to the pool
            if self._original_response and not self._original_response.isclosed():
                self._original_response.close()

            raise ReadTimeoutError(self._pool, None, 'Read timed out.')

        except BaseSSLError as e:
            # the response is not not closed we must do it now to ensure that the
            # connection is released back to the pool
            if self._original_response and not self._original_response.isclosed():
                self._original_response.close()

            # FIXME: Is there a better way to differentiate between SSLErrors?
            if 'read operation timed out' not in str(e):  # Defensive:
                # This shouldn't happen but just in case we're missing an edge
                # case, let's avoid swallowing SSL errors.
                raise

            raise ReadTimeoutError(self._pool, None, 'Read timed out.')

        except HTTPException as e:
            # This includes IncompleteRead.
            # the response is not not closed we must do it now to ensure that the
            # connection is released back to the pool
            if self._original_response and not self._original_response.isclosed():
                self._original_response.close()

            raise ProtocolError('Connection broken: %r' % e, e)
   # this can be moved here since you're not using the connection anymore (are you?)
   # and therefore it can go back to the pool now - will speed things up a little
    finally:
        if self._original_response and self._original_response.isclosed():
            self.release_conn()

        self._fp_bytes_read += len(data)

        try:
            if decode_content and self._decoder:
                data = self._decoder.decompress(data)
        except (IOError, zlib.error) as e:
            raise DecodeError(
                ""Received response with content-encoding: %s, but ""
                ""failed to decode it."" % content_encoding, e)

        if flush_decoder and decode_content and self._decoder:
            buf = self._decoder.decompress(binary_type())
            data += buf + self._decoder.flush()

655,Default timeout,2015-06-24T10:33:07Z,,,,,"o/

In [util.Timeout](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/8b5e457b756b2ab4c02473f7a42c2e0201ecc7e9/requests/packages/urllib3/util/timeout.py#L19), urllib3 use the socket global default timeout, but not the ""user set"" default timeout, probably modified by `socket.setdefaulttimeout(10)`, so ignoring any `socket.setdefaulttimeout`. Why ?

I think it would be cool to be able to set a ""setdefaulttimeout"" and have it impact `urllib3`, so also impacting `requests`.

In another hand, one should not know that `urllib3` or `request` use `socket` under the hood, and doing a `socket.setdefaulttimeout` to configure the default timeout of `urllib3` or `requests`  tie them, I mean, if you change the underlying used module, the timeout will still be applied, but to the wrong module, so probably being ignored. Also this is surprising to set a setting on a module A to impact the behavior of module B.

So we have pros and cons here, but totally ignoring socket.setdefaulttimeout may not be the better solution, conversation opened :)

        if release_conn is None:
            release_conn = response_kw.get('preload_content', True)
```

which means that if it is a chunked response, it will be closed immediately without the requesting library being able to read the content, since

``` python
~/soft/infra-virtenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/response.py:135
        # We certainly don't want to preload content when the response is chunked.
        if not self.chunked and preload_content and not self._body:
            self._body = self.read(decode_content=decode_content)
```

This is fine, as long as the connection doesn't get reused, but under heavy load it causes things to break really badly.

But you call it with release_conn=True (since you've just set it to true) - what happens if that call succeeds? You'll release the conn back to the pool before the response is read. At least that's what it looks like to me.

I think it should be one of the requirements specified here; at worst, it will already be installed in the user's Python and be a no-op.

However, when a timeout error occurs or the connection is dropped the connection is closed but not returned in to the pool (since the response is None). This problem is compounded when retries are turned on since the next attempt will grab a new connection from the pool thus depleting it further. With non-blocking pools this is not a problem since we will create a new connection if the pool is empty but when the pool is blocking we have found that eventually the pool size becomes zero (after no.of connections timeout errors) which causes the calling application to hang on it's next request.
This can be fixed in connectionpool.urlopen in the exception handlers by explicitly returning the closed connection to the pool via _put_conn (if release_conn is false), since subsequent calls to _get_conn will check if the connection has been dropped and return a new one.

Again and again, because I have cable and Wifi network, different IP, I want to do load balancing to improve my network speed and use as much bandwidth as possible, problem is how I can change source_address every request create, please me some tips to finish this problem.

Here is my test code, not even a proxy:

import urllib3
http = urllib3.PoolManager(num_pools=10, source_address=('192.168.1.110', 0))
http.source_address = ""192.168.1.3""

r = http.urlopen('GET', 'http://www.ghacks.net/ip/')
print(r.data.decode('utf-8'))
print(http.headers)
print(r._original_response.msg)

The line ""http.source_address = ""192.168.1.3"""" seem do nothing, the IP show still 192.168.1.110's IP.

It is possible because there is software already did that, dispatch-proxy in NodeJS but it is not perfect, at least there is no HTTPS support so I decide to write my own.

Thank!

In my benchmarks testing with a 50 MB file:
- curl can upload the file in 0.5s (just for context)
- requests + urllib3 using the current implementation takes over 20 seconds (20-22s)
- requests + urllib3 with that fix reverted (`sendall` instead invokes `self.connection.sendall(data)`) uploads the file in 1.15s

The cost appears to be a result of a combination of two factors:
- OpenSSL will only write up to 16384 bytes at a time (the limit derives from the maximum amount of plaintext in a single SSL record)
- sendall() makes a copy of `data` (removing what was already sent), which is copying the entire payload

So with a 50 MB file, urllib3 is performing over 3000 allocations with an average size around 25 MB.  It gets worse when I try uploading even larger files...

Something like the following restores the performance.  There are still a large number of string copies, but they're of a limited (fixed) size.  I should add that I thought about using a memoryview here instead of the slices, but pyOpenSSL immediately turns around and casts back to bytes, so I didn't see a need for the complexity.

``` python
    def sendall(self, data):
        total_sent = 0
        while total_sent < len(data):
            sent = self._send_until_done(data[total_sent:total_sent+16384])
            total_sent += sent

```

With this implementation, I'm again seeing uploads complete in about 1.15s.

617,API to use custom SSLContexts in VerifiedHTTPSConnection/HTTPSConnectionPool,2015-05-12T04:11:11Z,2015-05-12T05:04:34Z,,,,"I'd like to request an API for passing a custom `SSLContext` to higher level APIs, so that it eventually gets passed to `ssl_.ssl_wrap_context`. My motivating use case is that I'd like to selectively re-enable RC4 when talking with poorly configured servers. (see #551) It seems like [this](https://gist.github.com/paxswill/5ed7273059b34e90b184) is currently the best way to enable old ciphers, but I think it would be preferable to create a `SSLContext` using `_ssl.create_urllib3_context`, and then pass that to the `HTTPSConnectionPool` constructor.

To that end, I propose the following API change. A `context` keyword argument is added to the constructor of `VerifiedHTTPSConnection`. If present, this `SSLContext` is passed to `ssl_.ssl_wrap_context`. If a `context` is passed to `HTTPSConnectionPool`, it will be passed through to `VerifiedHTTPSConnection`.

Does this approach sound good? If so I'd be happy to start a PR. I see there are tests and docs to update; is there anything else I should look at?

616,UnicodeEncodeError handling gzipped responses on Google App Engine,2015-05-11T20:37:26Z,2015-05-11T21:09:55Z,,,,"https://github.com/braintree/braintree_python/issues/53 originally reported the issue. It's due to using requests 2.6.1+, which pulled in a version of urllib3 including f21c2a2b73e4256ba2787f8470dbee6872987d2d, which causes the problem.

I am able to reproduce using app engine development mode when switching https://github.com/agfor/braintree-python-appengine to use requests 2.6.1+ and un-commenting out the development mode enabling code in main.py.

615,InsecurePlatformWarning is end-user unfriendly,2015-05-09T19:36:47Z,,,,,"I filed https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2681 when pip started throwing IPW's all over the place, and we've had other folk be confused as well.

Now,  I understand the cause and support the intent of exposing insecure situations for users.

However the page linked to is hard to understand for a couple of reasons.

The page as a whole is focused on developers and the history behind security in urllib3, but end users don't need all that context (and the advice for developers, like the InsecureRequestWarning section, is entirely irrelevant to them). Because the link is to a # reference in the page, and one near the end of the page, the actual advice doesn't appear at the top of the users browser screen, but in a narrow section at the bottom (try opening the page in a 4K browser window...). Lastly, _nearly everyone_ that hits this will need the actual advice: https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#openssl-pyopenssl for which they have to chase pointers.

If I may suggest, putting the #insecureplatformwarning reference at the top of the document, and inlining the pyopenssl recipe into it would make this a whole bunch clearer and hopefully make things a lot clearer for users encountering this issue in an application.

This has been observed with requests 2.6.2 (containing the new chunked handling) but not with requests 2.6.0 (containing the old broke stuff), which moves along just fine.

Now, it's worth noting that Google has totally screwed up here, because the response is invalid, as this Wireshark trace shows:

Note that Google have sent Transfer-Encoding: chunked, but no body. This is, as far as I can tell, against all the relevant RFCs: a zero length body has a valid chunked representation (`0\r\n\r\n`). 301 is also not defined as having no body.

Regardless, however, curl gets this right, so we should too if at all possible. We should also confirm whether this is a problem for older versions of urllib3 or whether they too function correctly.

---

I confirmed this worked by linking my working copy of urllib3 into requests and testing against the site in the original issue on requests, e.g., by doing

``` py
import requests
r = requests.get('https://liquidstate.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/serverInfo')
r.json()
```

I simply didn't have time to write a test case. Also IMO a better solution would be to make `read_chunked` handle this instead of `stream` but this was the fastest hotfix I could produce. I'm adding both @shazow and @Lukasa to my fork so they can dev on this if they want from the same branch

As a result, one can't easily create Tornado HTTPRequests from WSGI parameters (I ran afoul of issue https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/1118, which has since been fixed, but it is still safer to avoid it entirely).
fwiw, creating HTTPRequest from WSGI values this way doesn't make sense when the whole point of Tornado WSGI wrapper is to convert HTTPRequest _to_ WSGI values, so, um.

This is a rather crude but practical way to use Tornado RequestHandler directly instead of the WSGI runaround.

In the second commit, I make the socket-based tests time out instead of hanging forever if for whatever reason the server fails to start. A similar change might be useful for the HTTP tests, but it's not as straightforward, so maybe next time ;)

It seems that if you hit an endpoint that sets both Content-Encoding: gzip and Transfer-Encoding: chunked, and then use `Response.stream()` with `decode_content=True`, we don't decompress the content. That represents an API change, and I'd argue a regression.

This feature would significantly increase SSL performance by improving latency and computing time.  The standard library does not support this feature as there seems to bug opened for this case http://bugs.python.org/issue8106 .

The new release version (0.14) of pyOpenSSL has opened number of callbacks from the subset of OpenSSL library. The particular API called 'set_session' or set_session_id 
(http://pythonhosted.org/pyOpenSSL/api/ssl.html#OpenSSL.SSL.Connection.set_session)
 can be use to enable SSL session reuse through Session Identifiers.  To support this capability two task needs to be executed 
1. Store the initiated established session for particular host:port so that we can reuse the same session for the subsequent request.
2. Use already created context associated for particular host:and port.

Any plans to integrate this feature in future release?.

What it basically means is that `sock` that is passed to select[1] is `>= 1024`. That may happen for example if application opens 1024 files on start and then gets `OpenSSL.SSL.WantReadError` during TLS handshake while using urllib3.

Regression was introduced in: a49bec58fa5f7aca76d1d0b2f1975eb094648eab [pyopenssl: wait for data before handshake retry]

Simple fix is to factor out functionality for poll -> select fallback from https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/util/connection.py#L12 and replace all `select.select()` calls in urllib3 with it.

583,urllib3 should use URLFetch to create HTTPS connections on AppEngine,2015-04-08T05:59:55Z,,Help Wanted,,,"AppEngine is listed as a supported platform for `urllib3`.

However, it appears to use the [Sockets API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/) in order to make HTTPS connections, as a result of it using [`socket` from the standard library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html) to make the connection.

As a result, this will exhaust quota much faster than if it wrapped the [URLFetch service](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch/), and is only available to billed (non-free) applications.

Attempting to use it on a free application results in an error.

Additionally, the Sockets API is beta service, and it is [impossible to connect to Google's HTTPS services using the Sockets API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/#limitations-and-restrictions).

Instead, `urllib3` should use URLFetch by default in order to send HTTPS requests on AppEngine, and [use a similar fallback mechanism to `httplib` in order to fall back to using `socket`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/#making_httplib_use_sockets).

In order to distinguish these at the `urlopen` level, I had to split `_make_request` into two functions. Otherwise, you have to distinguish between errors between all three of socket connect/write/read; did the `ETIMEDOUT` occur on the connect or the read?
- This gets ugly since we want to pass a lot of state from the first function to the second function, in particular the `conn` object and the `timeout`.

try:

Which means that it's going to prefer whatever ciphers Python prefers. However given that it's much easier to upgrade urllib3 (or requests or pip or ...) than it is to upgrade Python and that urllib3 (etc) has a much shorter release cycle I believe it would be a better idea to just ignore the ciphers that Python likes and just have urllib3 set it's own default ciphers.

559,Extend certificate fingerprinting support.,2015-03-03T21:18:45Z,,,,,"While urllib3 has certificate fingerprinting support, it would be extremely powerful to have more fine-grained fingerprinting support. In particular, the current support is very binary: either you fingerprint or you don't. If you want to fingerprint on only some domains you need to abandon the PoolManager entirely, because you need to set `assert_fingerprint` on the ConnectionPool object before you call urlopen.

It would be very nice if it was possible to do fingerprinting on a more granular level. Some options:
- pass `assert_fingerprint` a function that returns a fingerprint for a given hostname. 
- pass `assert_fingerprint` a dict of hostnames to fingerprints

In all cases we'd fall back to asserting hostname or other if the user does not provide a fingerprint for a given hostname.

This would allow users to fingerprint where they can or choose to, while not preventing them from making less-secure HTTPS calls.

Thoughts?

Tested in versions 1.9, 1.9.1, 1.10.

The way I've been testing is to use netcat to listen for connections but not respond to CONNECT, eg.:

```
$ nc -l localhost 8000
```

Then making a request with that ""proxy"":

```
In [1]: import urllib3
In [2]: pm = urllib3.ProxyManager('http://localhost:8000/')
In [3]: r = pm.request('GET', 'https://httpbin.org/ip', timeout=1.0)

MaxRetryError                             Traceback (most recent call last)

At that point, `lsof` shows multiple connections (one per retry) in CLOSE_WAIT state, which stay that way permanently.

It looks like the issue is related to a circular reference preventing a socket from being cleaned up properly. For example, this commit fixes the issue: https://github.com/ianpreston/urllib3/commit/a0953a93c877468d9b60a6785c767c5ac31d0dc2 , as does wrapping the `raise` statements in `Retry.increment` with a ""finally: del _stacktrace"".

The workaround above is working for now but I'd like to find the root cause, or at least a workaround that doesn't break stack traces. Any idea where to start looking? Thanks

547,Unexpected retry type required for connection failure on LAN,2015-02-09T15:21:59Z,,,,,"Retry-attempts to connect to a disconnected local machine, without setting a timeout, are affected by the 'read' parameter, rather than the 'connect' parameter.  This is confusing, as it does not seem to be in compliance with the documentation, nor is it the same behaviour as when either a) using a connection timeout, or b) attempting to connect to a non-existant remote machine, both of which are correctly affected by the 'connect' parameter.

Looking at the back-trace I suspect this is because the reported OSError is treated as a ProtocolError, rather than a problem establishing the connection: `ProtocolError('Connection aborted.', OSError(113, 'No route to host'))`

Using the latest requests release (2.5.1) the problem is evident using:

``` python
import requests
s = requests.Session()
retry = requests.packages.urllib3.util.Retry(total=None, connect=10, read=2, redirect=5, backoff_factor=0.1)
s.mount('http://', requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry))

544,Faster headers implementation,2015-02-05T10:58:11Z,2015-02-19T06:30:22Z,,,,"I had been trying to speed up urllib3 by monkeypatching with geventhttpclient. Unfortunately there is not too much gain, as lots of copying of response and header objects is done, which could largely be skipped, when the header and response objects would be sufficiently compatible and directly recognized and accepted as compatible, instead of being converted by lots of copying around.

So for the sake of better compatibility and speedups, I would have liked to directly create a header class - the standard urllib3.HTTPHeaderDict - by geventhttpclients c-parser when monkeypatching, which won't need any further processing from urllib3s response object. When I compared both header container implementations, turned out that the current urllib3 version isn't that fast as it could be. Below some timings comparing the old vs the new version, HTTPHeaderDict_ being the old version:

``` python
print ""Empty initializations""
%timeit h = HTTPHeaderDict_()
%timeit x = HTTPHeaderDict()

print ""Initializations with data""
%timeit h = HTTPHeaderDict_(asdf='ddd', abc='100', ddd='200', efg='300')
%timeit x = HTTPHeaderDict(asdf='ddd', abc='100', ddd='200', efg='300')

from random import choice
from string import ascii_lowercase as asciis
hdrs = dict((''.join(choice(asciis) for _ in range(9)),
             ''.join(choice(asciis) for _ in range(9))) for _ in range(200))

print ""Initializations with more data""
%timeit h = HTTPHeaderDict_(hdrs)
%timeit x = HTTPHeaderDict(hdrs)

h = HTTPHeaderDict_(asdf='ddd', abc='100', ddd='200', efg='300')
x = HTTPHeaderDict(asdf='ddd', abc='100', ddd='200', efg='300')

print ""Fetching items""
%timeit h.__getitem__('abc')
%timeit x.__getitem__('abc')

print ""Copying""
%timeit h.copy()
%timeit x.copy()

print ""Adding headers""
%timeit h = HTTPHeaderDict_(); [h.add(k,v) for k, v in hdrs.iteritems()];
%timeit x = HTTPHeaderDict(); [x.add(k,v) for k, v in hdrs.iteritems()];

h = HTTPHeaderDict_(hdrs)
x = HTTPHeaderDict(hdrs)

print ""Iteration of keys""
%timeit [k for k in h]
%timeit [k for k in x]

print ""Iteration of values""
%timeit [h[k] for k in h]
%timeit [x[k] for k in x]

print ""Getting keys""
%timeit h.keys()
%timeit x.keys()

print ""Getting values""
%timeit h.values()
%timeit x.values()
```

For my machine, I get the following timings:

```

1000000 loops, best of 3: 858 ns per loop

```

The new version passes all current tests, though it comes with one downside, which is worth discussing: It's not storing the original case of the header items. While the current version stores that, and therefore can restore the case if desired e.g. when iterating over the keys, this implementation is consequently using lower case, except when pretty printing the object. The standards require case insensitivity, so not preserving the case seems to me like an acceptable, maybe even desireable behaviour. Furthermore, also the current implementation has to drop the case information, when joining same header items together.

In terms of compatibility, I hope this should work with all python versions, though I mainly tested it on 2.7.

543,Python 2.7.9 breaks ssl_wrap_socket,2015-02-04T09:25:55Z,2015-02-07T01:28:33Z,,ValueError,ValueError: check_hostname requires server_hostname,"The following code is in `urllib3/util/ssl_.py`, in `ssl_wrap_socket`:

It seems that with `check_hostname` set to true (the default on Python 2.7.9) we _must_ pass the `server_hostname` argument.

542,No Retry in HTTPResponse.read() method.,2015-02-03T00:00:21Z,,,,,"It appears that the retry support in urllib3 doesn't cover the HTTPResponse.read() method. This means that if you pass `preload_content=False` to `urlopen()` as requests does, that any errors that occur while `read()`ing the body will not automatically be retried. Doing this transparently would be difficult to do since urllib3 doesn't know what the calling library has done with the parts of the body it's already received.

What _would_ be nice though is to provide the `Retry()` object on the response object and provide instructions for how the caller of the library can use it to implement retries themselves. Perhaps this could look something like:

``` python
response = pool.urlopen(...)
while not response.closed and not response.retries.is_exhausted():
    try:
        data = []
        data.append(response.read(4096))
    except response.retries.exceptions as exc:
        # This would raise an error if there are no more retries
        response = response.retry()
```

Thoughts?

I would like to use your lib to replace some python2 code that I wrote with urllib2 and poster. Now i almost remember no details and I know that it was not easy back then, but your lib does not make it much easier because the documentation is not good:

What is the return value and in which function should I put the return value?

Maybe I am spoiled by strongly typed languages. But for me it is totally un-obvious how to use the lib. So please add more documentation.

The code is pretty good read and understandable (e.g. https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/request.py). I am still convinced that an beginner friendly update of read the docs would be a big benefit for new users.

This was found by virtue of @kennethreitz requests module bundling latest urllib3 and producing incorrect warnings all the time.

We are having to resort to ignoring the warning:

```
        with warnings.catch_warnings():
            warnings.simplefilter(""ignore"")

            r = session.post(url, params=params, headers=headers,
                    proxies=proxies, timeout=timeout, data=data,
                    verify=cert_loc)
```

517,Lean on SSLContext to do HTTPS hostname verification,2014-12-01T20:56:35Z,,,,,"In Python 3.4 and 2.7.9 there is a `check_hostname` attribute on `SSLContext` which will have the SSLContext instance handle checking the hostname inside of the `do_handshake`. I think it would be good for urllib3 to rely on this where possible instead of doing the check itself. I think this would go good with the other efforts to use `SSLContext` as the ""bag of configuration"" for TLS stuff.

This can be detected by determining if the `SSLContext` object has a `check_hostname` attribute or not.

There is one downside, this relies on passing the hostname as part of `SSLContext().wrap_socket(server_name=)`. Originally this only worked if the OpenSSL had SNI enabled. However Python 3.4.3 and 2.7.9 will accept `server_name` even if SNI isn't enabled.

This would mean that the code a little ugly until you drop older versions of Python 3, it would look something like (paraphrased and super simplified to just be the ugly parts):

``` python
import ssl
import sys

# In reality these would use the SSLContext shim that urllib3 has in
# order to work on Python 2.6 too and 2.7 earlier than 

if ssl.HAS_SNI or sys.version_info[0] == 2 or sys.version_info[:3] >= (3, 4, 3):
    ctx = SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
    ctx.check_hostname = True
    sock = ctx.wrap_socket(sock, server_name=""example.com"")
else:
    ctx = SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
    sock = ctx.wrap_socket(sock)

    if not ssl.match_hostname(sock.getpeercert(), ""example.com""):
        raise Error()
```

Maybe this is a bad idea? I think it would be great to lay the ground work for eventually moving the responsibility for checking hostnames into the stdlib, however you wouldn't actually be able to do that completely without the ugly if statement until 3.4.3 was your minimum supports Python 3 version.

511,RFC: Session traffic logging,2014-11-23T21:15:38Z,2014-11-23T21:43:15Z,,,,"This is an extension of [requests/#2352](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/2352).

Currently it's quite difficult to get usable debug information out of urllib3. Specifically being able to see the request/response data in a similar format as `curl -v`. Logging can be enabled on httplib, but this gets dumped in an unfriendly format, making it difficult to use.

This starts to become apparent when submitting POST data or extra headers, large amounts of data require mangling to make them readable (which involves copy/pasting into a custom tool, which is a pita).

It was suggested that wireshark would be a better approach, but this is not an easy option for everyone depending on how their local environment is set up, and arguably a lot of overhead when you can achieve this easily using `curl` debugging features. That being said, getting `curl` to log POST data is also [troublesome](http://superuser.com/questions/291424/how-do-you-display-post-data-with-curl).

One thing I would agree on is that capturing via Wireshark is going to be more accurate than analysing in code, due to the various layers involved and any bugs in logging code. 

@sigmavirus24 has made it clear he opposes any such feature request, so this ticket can be considered an RFC rather than a feature request. 

The best suggestion I can think of so far would be to add a debugging method on urllib3, however I'm not sure how feasible this is given that the logging output comes from httplib, and monkey-patching isn't really a great idea for obvious reasons.

Here is an example of debugging using urllib3;

```

507,Add ssl_context parameter to Connection classes,2014-11-21T05:08:07Z,2016-04-07T12:57:34Z,,,,"After creating a shim SSLContext class in urllib3.util.ssl_, we now want
to start accepting instances of that class in general so users can take
advantage of some features provided only on certain versions of Python.

The first step is to allow users to pass ssl_context to both
HTTPSConnection and VerifiedHTTPSConnection and then pass these down to
the shim ssl_wrap_socket function in urllib3.util.ssl_. This does not
yet account for use with PyOpenSSL.

---

So this basically just works except for the fact that the following will raise an InsecureRequestWarning:

``` python
import ssl
import urllib3
import urllib3.util.ssl_ as ussl


context = ussl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
context.load_verify_locations('../requests/requests/cacert.pem')
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED

manager = urllib3.PoolManager(ssl_context=context)
resp = manager.urlopen('GET', 'https://api.github.com/users',
                       preload_content=False)
```

Because the way I wrote `urllib3.util.ssl_.ssl_wrap_socket`, any settings on the the context set needs to be confirmed when creating the pool manager, e.g., the following works:

``` python
import ssl
import urllib3
import urllib3.util.ssl_ as ussl


context = ussl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
context.load_verify_locations('../requests/requests/cacert.pem')
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED

manager = urllib3.PoolManager(ssl_context=context,
                              cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED)
resp = manager.urlopen('GET', 'https://api.github.com/users',
                       preload_content=False)
```

I think if we have `urllib3.util.ssl_.ssl_wrap_socket` return early when given a valid context, we won't break any prior behaviour, but I have yet to test that. Does anyone have any thoughts?

504,HTTPS proxies don't respect connection timeouts,2014-11-13T20:00:15Z,2014-12-04T00:20:09Z,,,,"Code to reproduce (this will take a while to run)

``` python
import urllib3
from urllib3.util.timeout import Timeout
http = urllib3.ProxyManager(proxy_url='https://1.1.1.1', proxy_headers={})
http.request('GET', 'https://google.com', timeout=Timeout(connect=0.3, read=5))
```

The gist of it is, with HTTPS connections connect() gets called earlier in the urlopen() process than with a HTTP connection. Specifically, for HTTPS _new_conn will call _prepare_conn, which calls connect() on the socket, where for HTTP, the connect() call is delayed all the way until httplib.request.

urllib3 sets the connection timeout until after calling _get_conn, but before httplib.request, which explains why the timeout isn't set.

The obvious question is why isn't this an issue when you're not using a proxy? Well, prepare_conn only attempts the connect() if you're using a proxy, with the following note:

```
        # Establish tunnel connection early, because otherwise httplib
        # would improperly set Host: header to proxy's IP:port.
        conn.connect()
```

One way to fix would be to pass the request timeout along with the pool_timeout to `_get_conn` or break out the proxy connect() logic in prepare_conn into its own function.

```
> /Users/raulcd/Projects/requests/requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py(511)urlopen()
    510             # Request a connection from the queue.

    512

ipdb> self.cert_reqs
'CERT_NONE'
ipdb> n
ipdb> conn.cert_reqs
'CERT_REQUIRED'

So the requests should have `CERT_NONE` but the connection retrieved from the connection pool has `CERT_REQUIRED`.

I'll work in a fix.

I'm surprised no one has raised this issue, given how many people use the library. I'm forced to conclude
1. the python library is raising this error erroneously
2. everyone leaks sockets, and it's harmless
3. everyone leaks sockets, and no one cares because sockets are always available
4. the tests leak sockets more than most because they expose error conditions

What's going on? Is there something easy that can be done to fix this @sigmavirus24, @Lukasa, @jschneier , thoughts?

492,timeout can be raised during _validate_conn,2014-10-27T18:55:57Z,2014-10-28T04:42:12Z,,,,"Steps to reproduce:
- set up a port to accept incoming TCP traffic, and never send any data back (for example port 5501 on [hamms](https://github.com/kevinburke/hamms))
- make an HTTPS request to the port with a timeout

``` python
import urllib3, certifi
http = urllib3.PoolManager(cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED', ca_certs=certifi.where())
r = http.request('GET', 'https://localhost:5501/', timeout=3)

The traceback is roughly this:

    self._sslobj.do_handshake()
```

The error is a SSLError but it seems like this should be a timeout:

> SSLError: [Errno 0] The handshake operation timed out

We have logic to catch SSLErrors and raise them as timeouts, which would catch this:

```
    except BaseSSLError as e:
        # Catch possible read timeouts thrown as SSL errors. If not the
        # case, rethrow the original. We need to do this because of:
        # http://bugs.python.org/issue10272
        if 'timed out' in str(e) or \
           'did not complete (read)' in str(e):  # Python 2.6
            raise ReadTimeoutError(
                    self, url, ""Read timed out. (read timeout=%s)"" % read_timeout)

        raise
```

Unfortunately this code block doesn't catch this timeout which is raised during `_validate_conn`.

There are a few options here.
- duplicate the `if ""timed out"" in ...` logic around `_validate_conn`
- move the `if ""timed out"" in ...` logic up to urlopen. Existing read timeout errors would get caught in the `except (BaseSSLError, CertificateError) as e` block in urlopen, and not have the connection closed/replaced.
- do nothing and leave ""handshake timed out"" errors as SSLErrors.

I first noticed this when I started getting my requests rejected by the server when I started using pyopenssl. I had been using requests and had been passing a client certificate in like `requests.get(..., cert='foo.pem')`

When using the regular ssl library, we call ssl.wrap_socket, which uses the certfile as both the certfile and the keyfile if the keyfile is None [1].

When using pyopenssl, we should keep the same expectation.

487,SSL v3 is vulnerable,2014-10-15T03:11:19Z,,,,,"I'm trying to figure out whether this means that urllib3 is vulnerable.
- In browsers, failed connections are retried with a different, weaker protocol, which may be SSL v3, which is why Google is freaking out a lot about this. I don't think urllib3 has this problem.
- I am confused by the `ssl_wrap_socket` method in pyopenssl.py because it takes `ssl_version=None` as an argument. However the first line of the method calls 

``` python
OpenSSL.SSL.Context(_openssl_versions[ssl_version])
```

But `_openssl_versions[None]` will raise a KeyError.
- When it's run, CPython 2.7.8 and Pypy (2.7.6) use TLS v1.0 to secure the connection, at least [according to howsmyssl.com](https://gist.github.com/kevinburke/eb02e1e1984b9d2ce806). The only place I can see a default ssl version being set is in `resolve_ssl_version` which sets the version as PROTOCOL_SSLv23 if it's not explicitly set. I can't figure out where in the urllib3 code that TLS v1 gets set.
- This issue suggests a possible path to disabling: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues/471 Though the code path suggests this would only work for environments with an SSLContext. 

I'm still trying to work through all of this.

When trying to work with this new code I realized a) it's difficult to distinguish _why_ the request failed, without a corresponding exception, and b) it's probably not good to mix types for e.reason - currently error is a Exception and cause is a string.

I propose we introduce a `ResponseError` object that covers all errors when we received a full HTTP response from the server. and then change

```
raise MaxRetryError(_pool, url, error or cause)
```

to

```
raise MaxRetryError(_pool, url, error or ResponseError(cause))

If @shazow and @alekstorm are open to such a change, I don't mind diving in to this, because I have a handful of applications that aren't allowed to serialize their certificates and private keys to disk.

ProtocolError encompasses SocketErrors (DNS lookup failures, EADDRINUSE, ECONNRESET, ECONNREFUSED, etc), as well as the following exceptions in httplib (taken from CPython 2.7)

``` python
class HTTPException(Exception):

Some of these are raised before the connection is established and some aren't. I'm not sure catching them all as read errors is the best approach. It is ""simpler"" for some degree of simpler.

If you are looking for a recommendation I would recommend moving the httplib exceptions that happen after data has been written to the socket (ImproperConnectionState, BadStatusLine, LineTooLong, IncompleteRead) to be instances of RequestError, and then move ProtocolError to `_is_connection_error` in retry.py.

The retry handling is non-trivial and gets even more complicated as there's file objects and not strictly strings to deal with.

I believe the retry with file objects should:
1. seek file to beginning or position reported by tell() before reading the file object
2. FAIL if the file object does not support seeking

Currently if I understand correctly the current behaviour will corrupt uploads or result in Timeout error as I experienced before.

But if the connection go through proxy, the rewraping makes it be a `Proxy Error`, even if its no proy error (https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L553)

After speaking with @Lukasa on #python-requests, I think this has something to do with Python 3 built-in [BrokenPipeError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BrokenPipeError) (subclass of ConnectionError) not being handled.

I think the problem is in this code: [urllib3/connectionpool.py:535](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L535)

   the request. If the client sees an error status, it SHOULD
   immediately cease transmitting the body. If the body is being sent

   empty trailer MAY be used to prematurely mark the end of the message.
   If the body was preceded by a Content-Length header, the client MUST
   close the connection.

I don't have a full repro, but it appears in our tests that when sending a large request body, the httplib client used by urllib3 is not monitoring the receive socket for the error status.

437,HTTPResponse does not observe file-like object protocol if decode_content=True,2014-08-01T08:46:15Z,,,,,"My understanding was that urllib3's `HTTPResponse` is supposed to behave according to the file-like object protocol if `preload_content=False`. In particular, I would like to hand it over to another library that is able to read from a file-like object (e.g. lxml).

Unfortunately, the `HTTPReponse` does not appear to implement the protocol properly if `decode_content=True`. Test case:

```
import urllib3
print('urllib3 v{}'.format(urllib3.__version__))

http = urllib3.PoolManager()

response = http.request('GET', 'https://github.com',
                        headers={'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip'},
                        preload_content=False,
                        decode_content=False)
print('decode_content=False, read(1): expected 1 bytes, got {} bytes'.format(len(response.read(1))))
print('decode_content=False, read(500): expected 500 bytes, got {} bytes'.format(len(response.read(500))))

response = http.request('GET', 'https://github.com',
                        headers={'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip'},
                        preload_content=False,
                        decode_content=True)
print('decode_content=True, read(1): expected 1 bytes, got {} bytes'.format(len(response.read(1))))
print('decode_content=True, read(500): expected 500 bytes, got {} bytes'.format(len(response.read(500))))
```

Output:

```
urllib3 v1.9
decode_content=False, read(1): expected 1 bytes, got 1 bytes
decode_content=False, read(500): expected 500 bytes, got 500 bytes
decode_content=True, read(1): expected 1 bytes, got 0 bytes
decode_content=True, read(500): expected 500 bytes, got 1056 bytes
```

The problem with the first case is that I thought `.read()==''` means that the stream is consumed and/or has been closed. So a library might read 50 bytes, get an empty stream back and assume it has read the entire 'file', which wouldn't be the case with `HTTPResponse`.

Now you can argue that reading just one byte is unreasonable, but what's the minimal chunk size that still works? It appears to be 84 bytes for github.com, but it differs for other hosts.

The problem with the second case is that the file-object protocol defines the first parameter of `read()` as ""[Read at most size bytes from the file](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=read#file.read)"". `HTTPResponse` returns more however. lxml for example seems to have internal buffer overflows if `read()` returns more bytes than it requested.

I guess at the very least, the documentation should mention that `HTTPResponse` is not adhering to the file-like object protocol.

436,Make `preload_content=False` the new default?,2014-07-31T21:16:59Z,,,,,"More and more people want to use response objects as file-like objects (or streams). The default pre-consume-and-leave-nothing-to-read is confusing.

This would be a fairly substantial change which could cause leaks to old code using urllib3, so it would need to be a major release bump.

    return obj.closed
```

It is supposed to be treating obj as an opaque file-like object, but actually it is breaking into the object's implementation by checking the status of .fp.

The suggestion in https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-file-objects is that file-like objects have a .closed attribute.

I understand the issue is that HTTPResponse doesn't implement .closed but we should at least test for .closed -first-.

(Raising this issue because I have a custom file-like-object for which sniffing the .fp is the wrong behaviour and leads to wrong results).

I wasn't actually sure where to put the example, as there didn't seem to be a relevant specific area.  Hence, I put it as an additional ""usage"" example.  But if it belongs somewhere else, I can move it easily enough.

One important caveat: the example does _not_ work in the current master.  Apparently partial reading of `io` objects require the `readinto` method to also be implemented.  So the last couple commits do that and add a test to make sure it actually works as intended.

```

I've changed the url into something normal such as 'http://baidu.com' or 'http://www.google.com.hk' and the script above works well.

Downsides to consider:
- Where do we draw the line? (Can we come up with a good rule of thumb for what request information the HTTPResponse tracks vs what it should not?)
- How do we stay relatively efficient? (If we decide to store things like passed params, we may be pulling in and holding large payloads in the process.)
- We need to make sure we retain minimal coupling across the different levels (pool -> connection -> request, and back).

```
urllib3.connectionpool:HttpConnectionPool is full, discarding connection
```

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18466079/can-i-change-the-connection-pool-size-for-pythons-requests-module

I'm aware that I can increase the size of the HttpConnectionPool easily but I don't quite understand what it is and what value I can set to make it stop erroring out.

Reading http://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pools.html#urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool

> maxsize – Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful in multithreaded situations. If block is set to false, more connections will be created but they will not be saved once they’ve been used.
> block – If set to True, no more than maxsize connections will be used at a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

It seems as though the point is that it ""saves connections"" in order to reuse them.

I'm using greenlet threads (via celery/gevent) to make requests to a single domain, `https://subdomain.example.com`. My requests are all to different `:path` on this domain.

I'd like to reuse the saved cookies which is why I pickle my requests Session object and unpickle within each thread, but this is a huge overhead for no good reason.

My question is essentially:
1. what does saving these connections do in urllib3
2. if I have a concurrency of say 20, and I'm running 1000 tasks - do I need to set my HttpConnectionPool maxsize to 20 or 1000? 20 definitely didn't work when I tried it. Is this because I did not set block to True?
3. I don't care how many simultaneous connections I make to example.com at this time, my end goal is to just use the shared cookies (immutable) across my threads without pickling and unpickling.

383,Ability to disable connection pooling,2014-05-08T12:12:17Z,,,,,"My proxy doesn't play nice with connection pooling, it constantly resets the connection:

2014-05-08 13:56:32,026 [INFO ] requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool: Resetting dropped connection: pypi.python.org
```

So in this case it doesn't make sense to keep the connection at all. It would be great if there is an option to disable connection pooling. 

As this is a system wide setting it should be configurable independent of the caller, preferably a environment variable. I'm thinking about something like `URLLIB3_DISABLE_POOLS=1`.

Not sure which entry point would be most suitable for such a behavior. Right now I've patched `ConnectionPool._put_conn` to throw away the connection but there might be a better place.

Which is correct?  Why isn't `util.is_fp_closed` also in `HTTPResponse.closed`?
- If I want to know when a response is closed, it's not sufficient to wrap `HTTPResponse.close` as https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/b8128d6b1ec52bc57499a87eb3f7a73e359c6a6a/requests/packages/urllib3/response.py#L192 short-circuits the call.  Why can't `HTTPResponse.read` call `HTTPResponse.close` on exhaustion?

Here's some context: I'm writing a library that ultimately uses urllib3 in a concurrent programming setting.  I've discovered that it's possible to keep connections open long enough that a ""Too many files open"" exception can be thrown.  So, I need to attach a semaphore acquire after a connection is made (I'd use `HTTPResponse.closed` to test whether it's a ""streaming"" connection or not), and then wrap `HTTPResponse.close` with a bit of code that releases the semaphore.

Also tests both the standard and backported `ssl` implementations, skipping each if unavailable.

I've incorporated the `subjectAltName` support from the `contrib.pyopenssl` module and the `ndg-httpsclient` package into `backports.ssl` (thanks @kirkeby!), obviating the need for the former.

This shouldn't be merged yet (see TODO below), but feedback would be much appreciated (@shazow @lukasa @t-8ch).

TODO:
- ~~Vendor `backports.ssl`, rather than listing it in `test-requirements.txt` (currently undone for quicker iteration).~~
- [x] Figure out `install_requires`/`extras_requires` rules for `pyOpenSSL` and `pyasn1` in urllib3/`backports.ssl`.
- [x] Properly catch and re-throw more `pyOpenSSL` exceptions as their `ssl` equivalents.
- [x] Fix the hanging bug in the `backports.ssl` implementation of `TestHTTPS` - it's happening on Travis CI (though I've got it disabled for now), so it can't be just my machine. Could it be a bug in `pyOpenSSL` itself? Seems to be fixed by monkey-patching the Tornado dummy server's `ssl` with `backports.ssl.monkey.patch()`, so could also be an OpenSSL version problem.

370,Vendor `backports.ssl` package,2014-04-10T22:24:50Z,,,,,"(Continuing the conversation from [#367](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues/367#issuecomment-39660734))

I admit I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to do this - `backports.ssl` is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the standard `ssl` module, but since it depends on pyOpenSSL, we can't automatically switch to it unless the latter is installed as well. Does that mean pyOpenSSL should be vendored in as well, or specified in the `extras_requires` parameter to `setuptools.setup()`? Should we be automatically switching at all (with explanatory logging statements), or allow the user to configure which `ssl` implementation is used, or both? Should `backports.ssl` even be vendored, since it can be monkey-patched in by the user a la gevent with `backports.ssl.monkey.patch()`?

Note also that since OS X ships with an ancient OpenSSL by default, which Tornado relies on, the urllib3 test suite hangs on each of the methods in `test_https.TestHTTPS_TLSv1` unless `backports.ssl.monkey.patch()` is called or the user recompiles their Python against a newer (probably Homebrew-installed) OpenSSL.

Guidance here would be much appreciated; I'm prepared to make all necessary changes to `urllib3` and `backports.ssl` to get them to play nicely together, but I need to know your (@shazow's) vision for the interop first.

Fixing these bugs requires hunting down the place the connection became None what reveals the _true_ state of connection down the call stack where something bad has happened.

367,"Differences between standard SSL and Pyopenssl (ZeroReturnError, SysCallError)",2014-04-03T22:00:12Z,,,,,"We use urllib3 via requests with pyopenssl so we can have SNI support in python 2.7.3.

Since we switched, we've noticed more errors from requests. Specifically:
- ZeroReturnError
- SysCallError: (104, 'Connection reset by peer')
- SysCallError: (-1, 'Unexpected EOF')

It seems like these should all be caught somehow in contrib/pyopenssl.py so at the requests level, we don't have to worry about pyopenssl being different than the standard ssl module.

Here's a few of the ideas I'm considering:
- in `fileobject.read`, everywhere we are catching `WantReadError` also catch `ZeroReturnError` and make sure that data is an empty string and continuing
- In `inject_into_urllib3`, setting `connection.BaseSSLError = OpenSSL.SSL.Error`

Based on my limited understanding of pyopenssl (and python's standard _ssl.c) I'm probably missing something in trying to unify these interfaces. If somebody with more familiarity with this stuff can point me in the right direction I can try to formalize this stuff into a pull request.

366,reconnect issues via CONNECT proxies,2014-04-03T21:14:15Z,2014-06-03T21:51:14Z,,,,"if I connect to an https server via a CONNECT proxy (ProxyManager), and either the origin server or the proxy disconnects, then subsequent requests connect directly to the origin server and attempt to use it as a proxy. This is because the first time httplib.HTTPConnection._tunnel() is called, it changes the .host and .port to be the origin server's.

I have a patch that fixes this for me, but I don't think I will be able to produce a test case that tests for this issue. 
Two changes are required, and there is another that I think makes sense.
- is_connection_dropped should return True if the socket is None
- HTTPConnectionPool._get_conn should not reuse a dropped connection. (maybe only if it has proxies)
- The optional bit: self.auto_open should be set to 0 after self._tunnel() is called on a connection object. This prevents httplib from reconnecting on send. Instead, it will throw NotConnected(). auto_open being 0 could also be used as a flag to trigger the rest of the behavior.

Assuming you have a functioning proxy (for testing, I set up a simple proxy on apache on localhost), the following script should fail:

p=ProxyManager(proxy_url=""http://somewhere"")
r=p.request('GET', 'https://api.box.com/', redirect=False, headers={'Connection':'close'})

The fundamental issue here seems to be that `connection_from_host` assumes `host` will never be `None`, but

```
>>> urllib3.util.parse_url('http://@')
Url(scheme='http', auth='', host=None, port=None, path=None, query=None, fragment=None)
```

I suggest that `LocationParseError` should be thrown instead under these conditions, and that perhaps `parse_url` should do it (since it does not appear to support URL-schemes that don't have a netloc, and netloc-ful schemes with an empty host don't make sense).

For the record, this is _not_ academic - I actually encountered a webserver that returned a redirection to ""`http://@`"" while doing a moderate-scale survey of the interwebs.

For the tests. I decided to perform a real connection to `https://travis-ci.org/` . If it is not acceptable
I see one alternative, that can be performed on CI environment.

I can add https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/dummyserver/certs/cacert.pem to list of
root-ca of the system. For ubuntu (travis-ci.org ) it is like

``` bash
$ cp dummyserver/certs/cacert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
$ update-ca-certificates
```

But this change will break tests that check https connections without a specified ca_certs raises `SSLError`, because `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` will be used by default.
Not mentioning that modifying global ca-certs of the system of developers who wants to run the tests, is probably not acceptable.

- Adds support for retries, per the spec we laid out (mostly).
- Adds docs etc.
- Splits out util.py into submodules - I need to know what you want to do here because as written it would change from `urllib3.util.Timeout` into `urllib3.util.timeout.Timeout` which is not good.
- adds a new /successful_retry handler to the DummyTestCase which keys based on a `test-name` header and returns 200 only after the request has been retried once.
- I believe there are some API changes here.
  - some subclasses of httplib.HTTPException can actually be raised as connection errors because they imply the request never actually got sent to the server.
  - urlopen previously would retry on read timeouts, which violated the urlopen contract (as I understood it) of only retrying things that couldn't possibly be side effecting. this code does not retry read timeouts by default.

I am also testing this in two new environments - in the office which places my IP on 10.\* subnet and I think has weird/different behavior when connecting to TARPIT_HOST than do standard wifi networks, and without an Internet connection, in which case a bunch of tests fail. Also, it's difficult to test some of these exceptional cases because the errors raised rely on the network stack, which (I think) is why the tests are failing on the branch. I'm still looking into it.

Either way I am losing some confidence in the connection timeout tests; getting a network to reliably generate ECONNREFUSED, or not generate it and tie up a connection, is tricky, unless we want to go down a path like this: http://bugs.python.org/file26890/test_timeout.patch

I'm considering the following:
- Adding a method to handlers.py that tracks state on the class, or resets a class property (""attempts"") every test. Then add a method that checks the attempts property and returns a response based on its value.
- Setting a ""attempts"" cookie on the response and adding cookie parsing to urllib3. Are we even supposed to do this, for example if someone sets a cookie on a 3xx response? However I am not looking forward to adding cookies.
- Mocking `_make_request` to side effect different things - I know it's not great to use mocks but the mock library does have support for this.
- Using the same approach as the retries test in test_socketlevel.py, which is a bit lower level than I'd like but will do just fine.

This particular suite has been lifted from the [current master of twisted](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/twisted/internet/_sslverify.py#L995), but provides a whitelist that prefers forward secrecy for key exchange, AES-GCM for encryption (with fallbacks for CBC and 3DES if AES is unavailable), and disables null auth, etc. This was derived by @hynek, so if there questions about it we can drag him in to answer.

312,Redirect from https -> https sends wrong host header,2014-01-10T21:54:16Z,,,,,"I cant give the actual url causing this problem, but this is the gist of the issue...

1) sending request to a HTTP server via proxy. Using ProxyManager. assume url is http://foo.com/image.jpg
2) Receive a redirect to a https://foo.com/image.jpg
3) GET https://foo.com/image.jpg
4) 301 redirect: http://foo.com/image.jpg
5) GET http://foo.com/image.jpg
6) 301 redirect https://foo.com/image.jpg
7) GET https://foo.com/image.jpg
8 301 redirect https://bar.com/image.jpg

at this point, I expect the request to https://bar.com/image.jpb to succeed. However, urllib3 does not send the correct request. The host header that it sends in the request is for foo.com, due to which bar.com rejects the request.

Here is the stack where it is happening

```
-> return self.urlopen(method, redirect_location, **kw)
  /home/botouser/git/myapp/src/main/python/eggs/urllib3-1.7.1-py2.7.egg/urllib3/poolmanager.py(256)urlopen()

-> return self.urlopen(method, redirect_location, **kw)
```

and the current state:

```
(Pdb) p (url,redirect_location)
('https://foo.com/image.jpg', 'https://bar.com/image.jpg')
(Pdb) p kw
{'redirect': True, 'retries': 1, 'assert_same_host': False, 'headers': {'Host': u'foo.com', 'Accept': '*/*', 'user-agent': 'my-app'}}
(Pdb) 
```

As you can see, the url is pointing to the correct location, but the host header in the headers collection is wrong.

Is there any way to work around this bug?

304,Follow HTML 5 draft and avoid RFC 2231 by default.,2014-01-06T02:19:32Z,,,,,"This passes the request object along for field rendering. Two attributes of the request object control that rendering:
- `field_encoding_style` which may be `HTML5` or `RFC2231` controls
  the encoding of non-ascii field names and file names.
- `form_data_encoding` can be set to encode the form with something other than UTF-8.

See [the current (as of this commit) draft version of the HTML 5 standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-html51-20130528/) for details on their idea of [how to format multipart/form-data](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-html51-20130528/forms.html#multipart-form-data).

These changes addresses shazow/urllib3#303.
"
303,Consider HTML 5 draft for multipart/form-data,2014-01-04T23:59:35Z,,,,,"In several past posts, I've tried to make urllib3 more standards-compliant, the way I saw things. In particular, #120 aimed at adding a proper `Content-Type` header for _every_ form field, and #119 / #223 introduced [RFC 2231](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2231) format for file name encoding.

One consequence of that last change was my noticing that tornado doesn't decode that format, causing some test cases to fail. e11e03628f8b82021a74ba7f5b39ce9ad9011382 monkey-patched tornado to deal with that, and I filed facebook/tornado#868 to take this upstream. There [bdarnell pointed out](https://github.com/facebook/tornado/pull/869#issuecomment-23632083) the following:

**The current HTML 5 draft has [a section on multipart/form-data](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/forms.html#multipart-form-data) which explicitely forbids the use of `Content-Type` for non-file fields, and also the use of RFC 2231 format for file names. It also provides its own mechanism for encoding field names.**

Although I'm reluctant to abandon conformance with Standards Track RFCs for the sake of some lines in a draft, it appears that the HTML 5 draft might better reflect what current web servers actually implement, or are going to implement in the intermediate future. Perople have already [reported problems](http://stackoverflow.com/q/20591599/1468366) with our format in the wild. For this reason, I wonder whether the current choice of always using RFC 2231 might have to be revised.

I can imagine two approaches, one would be dropping RFC 2231 support completely, the other would be introducing some switch to distinguish cases. I guess (although I don't like it) that the switch should default to the HTML 5 way. I guess I'd implement the switch as a global variable, since every field needs acces to it and concurrent use of multiple standards should be very unlikely. Do you have a better suggestion?

So what would be needed for HTML 5 conforming handling of encodings? We'd need to properly distinguish between files and non-files. The [`RequestField` class](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/fields.py#L53) could probably check whether both file name and content type are `None` to recognize non-file fields. That choice could be used to control the addition of the `Content-Type` header.

For file names, we'd have to encode them to UTF-8 (or some user-configurable request encoding?), after making sure the result does not contain any invalid data: newlines must be stripped (or converted to spaces), quotation marks and backslashes quoted by `\` or substituted. I'm not sure which of these, and how much control we want to give our users over that process.

If we allow for encodings other than UTF-8, which are not able to represent all Unicode codepoints, then we might need some more work. File name characters which are not representable must then be substituted or approximated somehow. For filed names we'd have to make sure we replace non-representable characters as XML decimal character entities instead. Other non-ASCII header fields should usually not occur, but if they do, I guess they should be treated the same way file names are.

I notice that I made a mistake in reading [RFC 2388](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388): its [section 5.4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388#section-5.4) states that field names are subject to a different encoding than file names. Grrr! Whoever though of that?!? In any case, to be conforming to that as well, we might even want to revise the RFC2231-using mode if we decide to keep it at all.

I might find the time to write some of this myself, but before I start, I'd like to discuss the open questions above as to how this should get implemented.

295,HTTPS Proxy Connections don't play with with Connection: Close.,2013-12-07T09:41:52Z,2014-04-02T02:11:36Z,,urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError,urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError: Cannot connect to proxy. Socket error: [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer.,"This was actually spotted on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20437753/python-requests-library-cant-handle-redirects-for-https-urls-when-behind-a-prox).

To reproduce, set up a proxy that can handle the CONNECT verb (e.g. mitmproxy), then do as follows:

``` python
pman = urllib3.proxy_from_url('http://127.0.0.1:8080')
res = pman.urlopen('GET', 'https://www.paypal.com/')
```

You hit a nice big fancy error:

```
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py"", line 254, in urlopen
    return super(ProxyManager, self).urlopen(method, url, redirect, **kw)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py"", line 155, in urlopen
    response = conn.urlopen(method, u.request_uri, **kw)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py"", line 520, in urlopen
    'Socket error: %s.' % e)
urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError: Cannot connect to proxy. Socket error: [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer.
```

This can be more clearly reproduced by turning off redirects:

``` python
pman = urllib3.proxy_from_url('http://127.0.0.1:8080')
res = pman.urlopen('GET', 'https://www.paypal.com/', redirect=False)
res = pman.urlopen('GET', 'https://www.paypal.com/', redirect=False) # Same error is hit here.
```

This is almost certainly because PayPal is sending back `Connection: Close` in the headers. This causes mitmproxy to close the upstream connection _and_ our connection to it, but we don't remove the connection from the pool.

293,Minor Suggestion,2013-12-04T04:36:21Z,2013-12-04T04:42:07Z,,,,"In `urllib3/_collections.py`, `RecentlyUsedContainer` has a pattern of

``` python

This could be DRY'd up to:

```
def dispose_of(self, value):
     if self.dispose_func:
         self.dispose_func(value)
```

And then all the other instances could just call:  `self.dispose_of(value)`. I have this on a [branch](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/urllib3/tree/dispose-of-method) but wasn't sure if it was of any value. (In my humble opinion those usages now read a lot better and no longer need to consider directly whether that function was provided.)

In reality it is a micro-optimization and it's one of personal preference.

284,SOCKS proxy support,2013-11-23T03:36:35Z,2015-12-29T20:29:03Z,,,,"Here's the SOCKS proxy support patch.

Usage is identical to setting HTTP proxies: `ProxyManager(""socks4://localhost:1080"")` or `ProxyManager(""socks5://localhost:1080"")` (or `proxy_from_url()`). Default ports for both are 1080.

I added new SOCKS Connection classes in `connection.py`, and added a `_is_socks` attribute to the proxy URL that is passed to `ProxyManager` (on the `Url` object). The `_is_socks` attribute is used by the connection pools so that HTTP proxy negotiation steps aren't taken when the proxy has a SOCKS scheme. This could possibly be refactored (separate `socks_proxy` and `http_proxy` attributes?); tell me how you feel about the `_is_socks` solution.

I also touched up some other parts of the codebase, as follows, which I noticed while working through files and debugging.
- Fixed inconsistent indentation in a few places.
- Fixed some typos in comments.
- Changed `__str__` methods to `__repr__`. `__str__` automatically defers to `__repr__` if it isn't already defined, but the reverse isn't true. So this keeps the same behavior while also allowing easier debugging from the REPL.
- Added a newline in the middle of the proxy connection exception message, to make it a little easier to read.

I believe this branch should currently work fine for regular usage; it seems to have no trouble with any SOCKS proxies.

However, I had many confusing issues and bugs while trying to modify the test suite. The tests are currently broken (I added `raise SkipTest()` in the proxy tests, for the time being). I am using Twisted for the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy servers, and added that to the test requirements.

The test issues seem to stem from the Tornado HTTP and HTTPS dummy servers. On my computer, they spat out odd SSL errors (like `SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:504: error:1411B072:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_NEW_SESSION_TICKET:bad message type
` and many others), and would hang seemingly randomly.

I upgraded the Tornado version in `test-requirements.txt` because the version listed before appeared to have a bug that prevented me (or others) from running in IPv6 mode, see here: https://github.com/facebook/tornado/pull/593; I had to upgrade to get IPv6-related tests to pass. I'm not sure if the upgrade has anything to do with the current issues.

I think it has something to do with trying to run Tornado in separate threads. I was not able to get multithreading to work with Twisted, so I spawned a new process for each SOCKS proxy server instead; Twisted seems to work fine, as I can connect to and use the proxy servers while the tests are running.

I would appreciate if someone could modify the tests so the HTTP servers work properly, or give me some advice on how to fix the issue. And of course, I'd appreciate any suggestions or changes for the SOCKS patch itself.

If you use `ProxyManager.urlopen()`, [this block of code](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/poolmanager.py#L247-L253) applies some HTTP headers:

``` python
if u.scheme == ""http"":
    # It's too late to set proxy headers on per-request basis for
    # tunnelled HTTPS connections, should use
    # constructor's proxy_headers instead.
    kw['headers'] = self._set_proxy_headers(url, kw.get('headers',
                                                        self.headers))
    kw['headers'].update(self.proxy_headers)
```

But no such code back exists when using `ProxyManager.connection_from_url`.

I'm open to providing code to fix this, but am not sure I can do so tonight, so if someone else would like to they should feel free.

269,Potential implementation of urllib3.util.Retry,2013-10-20T23:01:29Z,2014-06-01T03:13:39Z,,,,"Reference PR for #260 , as mentioned in the last commit

No tests, no docs, etc, just trying to push through this to see what the
logic's like. Some things I don't like:
- it's fairly repetitive, we call increment/exhausted every time there's an
  error, and once when we have a response.
- checking the response twice, once in increment and once in is_retryable
- calling `_connect_error_count` from outside the class
- conflict between individual retry and total retry values causing tests to
  fail, need to nail down this behavior
- setting default timeout for a specific test instead of all of them

Control won't be returned to the caller and you can't kill it with a KeyboardInterrupt.

This sets a default timeout on the socket so control is eventually returned and the tests complete.

267,At least some HTTPExceptions imply the client sent data,2013-10-20T17:57:56Z,2014-07-03T23:23:43Z,,,,"Generally `MaxRetryError`s are handled as a `ConnectionError`, which implies by its name that the connection did not succeed and is safe for the client to retry, see for example https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L356

The code [here](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L510) aggregates HTTPExceptions and socket errors. However some instances of HTTPException imply the request made it to the server - `BadStatusLine`, `UnknownProtocol`, `IncompleteRead`, `UnknownTransferEncoding` (which doesn't seem to be used anywhere but is defined and seems like it applies to the response) and `LineTooLong` in particular. Other HTTPExceptions imply the connection was not sent.

I'm not sure about the best way to tease these apart but it seems like lumping everything into MaxRetryError is maybe not the best way forward.

261,read timeout is not properly getting un-set,2013-10-18T18:08:04Z,2013-10-18T21:38:51Z,,,,"I discovered this issue when digging into the code here:

On my machine at least, creating a Timeout like this

``` python
from urllib3.util import Timeout
t = Timeout(connect=5)
make_some_request(timeout=t)
```

The socket timeout for the connect is properly set to 5 seconds. [This line](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L297), however, keeps us from resetting the timeout for the read, so it's still at 5 seconds for the read. It should be set instead to `socket.getdefaulttimeout()`.

260,More granular retry support,2013-10-16T18:07:30Z,2014-07-03T23:17:33Z,,,,"I'm not sure what the interface for this would look like, or even at what level this would be implemented, but essentially, more function-level control over retries would be awesome. This is roughly the behavior we build in around a `requests.request`:
- We want to retry pretty much everything on idempotent requests that's not a 2xx level response - for GET, PUT, DELETE methods, because these are safe to retry.
- We want to retry **all** connection errors and connection timeouts - these indicate the request never made it to the other machine. We usually use an exponential backoff here, in the case of network failure
- In general, we don't want to retry failed POST requests, whether they were timeouts, closed connections, or 5xx errors - consider a customer getting billed multiple times, or duplicate accounts being created, or something else bad.

Again, this might not be appropriate to build in at the library level (maybe we need better primitives for this internally) but adding all this logic around our http requests leads to pretty gnarly code. 

Some kind of  `Retries` object would be nice, especially because it mirrors the `Timeout` interface and there are a lot of things you could specify if you wanted to run wild with it, say the following:
- `connection_retries`, the number of times to retry a connection error
- what i'd like to call `read_retries` or the number of times to retry in a situation where a connection **was** made to the server. a timeout, a closed connection, or an unacceptable HTTP error code, like 500
- `retry_codes`, a list of integers representing HTTP status codes, could also have named constants for `NON_200`, `5XX_ERROR`, etc, would default to 500 range
- `method_whitelist`, a list of HTTP methods to retry, defaults to HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, per the [spec](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html)
- `backoff_factor`, some kind of multiplier to control how fast backoff occurs. Defaults to 0. Algorithm would be something like `backoff_factor * (2 ** (retry_attempt_number))`, so 1, 2, 4, 8...

253,Support passing TCP_NODELAY to underlying socket,2013-10-04T14:30:56Z,2014-01-27T20:13:57Z,,,,"Many people (including me) use urllib3 (or requests) to consume an API or to write a client for potential high-volume connections. In many cases performance of this can be severly impacted by the [Nagle's Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm#Negative_effect_on_non-small_writes). A solution to this is to run `.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)` on the underlying socket. This is however very hard to do with urllib3. The code to do so:

``` python
import socket
from urllib3.connectionpool import HTTPConnectionPool, HTTPConnection,\
    HTTPSConnectionPool, log as urllib3_log

class NoNagleHTTPConnection(HTTPConnection):
    def connect(self):
        super(NoNagleHTTPConnection, self).connect()
        self.sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)

class NoNagleHTTPConnectionPool(HTTPConnectionPool):
    def _new_conn(self):    
        """"""    
        Return a fresh :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.
        """"""    
        self.num_connections += 1      
        urllib3_log.info(""Starting new HTTP connection (%d): %s"" %
                (self.num_connections, self.host))
        return NoNagleHTTPConnection(host=self.host,
                            port=self.port,
                            strict=self.strict)
```

... and this is just when you use `HTTPConnectionPool` directly and for http only (more difficult for HTTPS).

I'd like to propose a solution to this problem, either being able to pass in a `connection_class` to be able to inject your own class (`NoNagleHTTPConnection` in my case). This could still get a little tricky with http/https.

Another possible solution is to be able to provide a callback that will be passed to the underlying connection class and called after the socket has been created.

Third solution that comes to mind is to simply support a flag (or just always specify `TCP_NODELAY`) to turn this behavior on.

I am leaning towards third but want to check with people before I do anything - I am more than happy to work on the solution since I use urllib3 as the default transport for the new [Elasticsearch client](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-py) - needless to say that performance is crucial for us there.

While Requests allows custom authentication (any class implementing AuthBase) to content servers, it only supports Basic auth to proxies. It would be great to support custom authentication for proxies too.

In particular, NTLM proxies are common in Windows corporate networks.  Python development can't get off the ground in my office because the package manager falls over at the proxy.

I note  urllib3's ProxyManager can only do Basic authentication, and not any other kind. https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/poolmanager.py#L174

For the complete rationale see kennethreitz/requests#1570 and linked issues.

Use a dedicated error class to indicate that the SSL handshake failed for technical reasons.
The code is a bit repetitive.
The other possibility would be to trigger the handshake in `connectionpool.py` which would require less duplication.
Keeping the actual handshake inside `ssl_wrap_socket` consistent with the current behaviour.

Another possibility would be to wrap the `ssl_wrap_socket` function inside `utils.py`

It appears that when the ES server is under heavy load that there are times when the `conn` variable is not initialized with a HTTPConnection and then the code attempts to 'close' it when it is put back in the pool.
This changeset merely validates that the `conn` variable passed in to `def _put_conn` is `truthy` before calling it's `close` method.

233,RFC: Fix WantReadError when using pyOpenSSL and Timeouts,2013-08-27T17:32:15Z,2013-08-27T19:40:55Z,,,,"Fixes the issues mentioned in kennethreitz/requests#749

Prevent WantReadError by using a fileobject which correctly handles those.
socket._fileobject which was previously used only handled builtin `EINTR` which
are is the corresponding error from the stdlib to WantReadError.
The new implementation inherits from socket._fileobject overwriting read() and
readline(). The overwritten methods are taken straight from CPython 2.7.5 and
modified as follows in the relevant places:

```
-except error, e:
-    if e.args[0] == EINTR:
-        continue
-    raise
+except OpenSSL.SSL.WantReadError:
+    continue
```

urllib3 itself only needs `readline()` overwritten, but requests also needs
`read()`.
The handshake could have been handled automatically by writes and reads, but
when requesting the certificate directly after connection setup an error is
thrown.

This method uses the knowledge of `httplib` to work out when we've actually exhausted the file-like object, which makes it harder to test.

Perhaps this should be increased to a higher block size to compensate for the gzip, and then any left over data would be stored in a buffer var. On the next read() call, it would check if the buffer has any data from the last read() and return that first, if there was not enough data it would also do another read().

Discussed briefly here;
https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1401#issuecomment-18829272

If you use .raw.read() on a gzip compressed request, it returns a bunch of unicode because of the compression. By default, I think it should use 'decode_content=True', as this is again a bit confusing. I can't think of any situation where we would want to read in non decoded data, or at the very least the majority of situations would not require this.

Thoughts??

```
>>> import io, requests
>>> r = requests.get('http://www.google.com',stream=True)
>>> io.BufferedReader(r.raw).read()
AttributeError: 'HTTPResponse' object has no attribute 'readable'
```

The base problem here is that `requests.packages.urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`  object (that's what `r.raw` is) does not respect the `io` API.  The following _does_ work, however:

```
>>> r = requests.get('http://www.google.com',stream=True)
>>> r.raw.readable=lambda:True
>>> r.raw.closed=False
>>> io.BufferedReader(r.raw).read()
```

Suggesting that the main thing that is neeeded is adding a `readable` method and a `closed` attribute to `HTTPResponse`.  (I think `flush` and `close` are probably also necessary, and maybe also `writable` and `seekable`).

Is there a reason this is not possible, or would it be fine to just add the relevant methods to `HTTPResponse`?

The reason is that:

however, request.**init**() would use 'http://www.google.com' as self.host, 
so 'http://www.google.com' == 'www.google.com' would be false.
And we should parse(url) first in request.**init**() to get the proper host.

I'd like to suggest a new feature - two types of timeouts.
Regular one - happens when we wait for response from server on existing connection.
And a new one - connection timeout. Raised only when we try to create a new socket connection.
I added new HTTPConnectionPool.**init** parameter - connect_timeout and two new exceptions ConnectionTimeout and OperationTimeout.
## 

But why anybody would need such a thing?

It can be useful when a call to some HTTP API takes a long time to answer the query (for ex. reading lots of data), but not so much to connect to the server.
With this new feature we can set bigger timeout (or even None which blocks until some data is read) and smaller connect_timeout, so network failures, dead API servers or DNS problems could be detected faster.

And thank you so much for the great library!

139,HTTPS proxy support (issue #50),2013-01-09T02:52:21Z,2013-07-19T17:57:19Z,,,,"This Pull Request resolves #50 adding HTTPS (CONNECT) proxy support to ProxyManager with minimal API and code changes.

A short summary of the changes:
- ProxyManager is a subclass of PoolManager now and its logic has been changed completely, though its constructor still accepts HTTPConnectionPool as the main argument so it's backwards compatible
- Tiny change to VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect() that introduces CONNECT tunneling support (copied from HTTPConnection.connect() code)
- HTTPSConnectionPool._new_conn() has been changed, but its logic for non-proxied connections stays the same
- HTTPSConnectionPool._new_conn() actually establishes the connection for proxied requests by calling HTTPSConnection.connect(), otherwise Host: header is set improperly due to httplib logic. As stated above, the behavior for non-proxied requests hasn't changed
- [tornado-proxy](https://github.com/senko/tornado-proxy) has been added for tests
- TornadoServerThread has been changed a bit - now it's possible to run multiple server threads in a single test case
- Added proxy tests
- Docs updated

All tests run fine with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2 on Mac OS 10.7.5, except for sporadic timeouts and SSL errors that occur against the unpatched library as well (and should be fixed separately). The code doesn't introduce any new regressions.

Possible TODOs and improvements:
- Proxy authentication (though that could be another libraries' responsibility, like [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests))
- When accepting proxy_pool as the first argument for ProxyManager, copy all pool properties and use them for other pool instances generation or even use it as the pool for HTTP proxy requests
- Usage of HTTPConnectionPool and, especially, HTTPSConnectionPool against proxy isn't really clear and requires some external logic - much like ProxyManager.connection_from_host()

120,More configurable metadata in filepost encoding requests,2012-11-23T16:49:23Z,,Someday,,,"This issue report (just like #119) is based solely on the specifications, and not backed by any real world problem I encountered _yet._

[RFC 2388 Section 4.5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388#section-4.5) states:

> In the case where a field element is text, the `charset` parameter for the text indicates the character encoding used.

The content type is optional in the case of `text/plain`, but in that case, the default charset is ASCII. So to ensure correct treatment, you should always add a header

```
 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""utf-8""
```

to text fields. At least if they are not ascii-only, but always adding it might be easier.

On the other hand, if the data is binary, i.e. considered to be the content of a file, then [Section 3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388#section-3) mandates:

> If the contents of a file are returned via filling out a form, then the file input is identified as the appropriate media type, if known, or ""`application/octet-stream`"".

So in those cases you should send a header of

```
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
```

I'm not sure how you'd best differentiate these two cases in the library, as you don't strictly distinguish between file content and text content. If the data is unicode, then I'd treat it as text. If the input is binary and not strictly ascii, then I'd treat it as a file. For binary ascii-only data, you might use the presence or absence of a file name to distinguish.

Furthermore, [RFC 2388 Section 4.3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388#section-4.3) states:

> The value supplied for a part may need to be encoded and the ""`content-transfer-encoding`"" header supplied if the value does not conform to the default encoding.

I haven't yet figured out what that “default encoding” is in this case, and where it is specified. But just to be sure, I'd suggest to add either of these to every content:

```
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
```

I must confess that I'm quite unsure about how these two differ, if at all. I have the gut feeling that `8bit` might be more suitable for text, particularly if its lines are not too long, and `binary` more suitable for file content. But as this is based mostly on my (very theoretic) understanding of how things work with SMTP as the underlying transport, I'm far from sure for HTTP.

119,Use international headers when posting file names,2012-11-23T16:25:32Z,2013-08-07T16:15:41Z,Someday,,,"[RFC 2388 Section 4.4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388#section-4.4) states:

> if the file name of the sender's operating system is not in US-ASCII, the file name might be approximated, or encoded using the method of [RFC 2231](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2231).

[Currently](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/8b610a305fe0c2c4123bf963b9b53423db8c423d/urllib3/filepost.py#L67), urllib3 does neither. Instead, it will simply UTF-8 encode the file name. While many receiving parties might be able to handle that situation, it appears to me like a violation of the specification, with all the impact this might have on interoperability.

To be more precise, when encountering a non-ascii file name like `Täst.txt`, it should send a header like this:

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""fieldname""; file*=utf-8''T%C3%A4st.txt
```

The same holds for non-ascii names of form fields. You can use [the `email.utils.encode_rfc2231` function](http://docs.python.org/2/library/email.util.html#email.utils.encode_rfc2231) to perform this kind of header formatting. For increased portability, you might want to only do so for cases that actually require it, keeping the current syntax for ascii-only names.

111,urllib3/filepost.py settings wrong form-data format,2012-10-30T00:04:48Z,2012-11-13T00:10:26Z,,,,"First, thanks for great library!

I think I may have found an issue with urllib3 handles parameters that aren't files when doing file upload. (multipart/form-data mime format).

In the last version (4d477a6ee695ccb64277f49f836f32a2e023cf4e), when we pass a field that's not file, it adds a `'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n'` between `'Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""%s""\r\n'` and the actual value of the field. Normally, if I understood well the specifications of the W3C (http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html) and after sniffing browser's behaviors with POST incorporating both file and params, the `'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n'` must not be here.

Basically, urllib3 is generating this : 

```
   Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=AaB03x

   --AaB03x
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""submit-name""
   Content-Type: text/plain

   Larry
   --AaB03x
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""files""; filename=""file1.txt""
   Content-Type: text/plain

   ... contents of file1.txt ...
   --AaB03x--
```

when it should have generated this :

```
   Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=AaB03x

   --AaB03x
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""submit-name""

   Larry
   --AaB03x
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""files""; filename=""file1.txt""
   Content-Type: text/plain

   ... contents of file1.txt ...
   --AaB03x--
```

A simple correction will be to replace filepost.py:75 by `body.write(b'\r\n')`

Hope it's helping and I am not using wrongly urllib3 (I was using requests library in fact and found that urllib3 might be the issue following the path of my real problem)

Ideas to cope with this:
- Solve #58
- Use [ndg-httpsclient](http://packages.python.org/ndg-httpsclient/), which is a wrapper around PyOpenSSL and provides a [`SSLSocket`-class](http://packages.python.org/ndg-httpsclient/ndg.httpsclient.ssl_socket.SSLSocket-class.html) which implements `makefile()`
- Just take the needed parts (`SSLSocket`) from ndg-httpsclient. ndg-httpsclient is BSD-licensed. One would also need a minor update to get python3 compability

I am in favour of the last point.

After a bit of investigation, it looks like the number of connections in the pool is slow decreasing over time as we encounter other errors, forced timeouts, etc.  On [urllib3/connectionpool.py:424](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/1c22dec48bc57199d71b86476dbed8f027877824/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L424), if httplib/socket raises an error, the connection will be dropped from the pool because it was acquired on [382](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/1c22dec48bc57199d71b86476dbed8f027877824/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L382) and never put back on line [431](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/1c22dec48bc57199d71b86476dbed8f027877824/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L431) since `conn == None`.

This issue can be replicated with the following gist (uses gevent.Timeout, so quasi-related to #69): https://gist.github.com/2932793

It looks like the `if conn` on line 431 was originally added to ensure that a SocketError raised from `_get_conn()` didn't add `None` to the pool since a connection would never be gotten, but in the current incarnation, it has the effect of causing the pool size to shrink over time if a connection is acquired and any error is raised from httplib/socket.

Web server, add some ""tail"" behind the data of gzip compression, data.
Some data-extracting modules (such as Python's GzipFile module) in this case will handle exceptions. The browser will automatically discard the extra ""tail"" normal extracting and processing of page data.
# Solve

The python GzipFile module undisclosed attributes: extrabuf responsible for the preservation has been successfully extracting data. Therefore, the following code for better compatibility:

58,Moving away from httplib,2012-03-13T08:50:36Z,,Someday,,,"Kicking off a tracking thread for some of the work started at the PyCon 2012 Requests/urllib3 sprints.

I'm not sure as to the full history of the issue, but the general driving factor is more transparency and control over behaviors that are overly opaque in the standard library's httplib, which seems to have been written without taking into account:
- Clean proxying
- HTTP parsing without establishing a connection
- Incremental HTTP parsing
- Raw socket control
- (and a few more features I can't recall)

The validity of these concerns was at least generally confirmed by Guido himself, in person, when @kennethreitz and I spoke to him and he agreed that certain batteries included with Python have started to lose their charge; libraries like urllib/urllib2/httplib are out of touch with the new momenta of web technologies.

The refactorings involved in fixing the above issues seem to point to a new httplib-like library that is more extensible and configurable. The emergence of libraries like @benoitc's [http-parser](https://github.com/benoitc/http-parser) also support this direction and urllib3 is certainly one of the best-positioned libraries for attempting this sort of enhancement.

Design discussions thus far have involved @shazow, @wolever, @atdt, @kennethreitz, @easel, @doublereedkurt, and @brandon-rhodes. More notes to follow.

This is more a request for comments than a request to pull, as I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it.

I've tried to make the tests as well, and hit a snag: to properly test it you need HTTP tunnelling-capable proxy and a HTTPS server that gives different results for HTTP and HTTPS (to test the proxy is really working), and I couldn't get the dummy server runner to have two tornado instances (one for the tunnel-capable proxy, other for the HTTPS server).

Example usage:

``` python

conn = proxy_from_url('http://127.0.0.1:%s/' % self.proxy_port,

Anyway, I am trying to find any kind of support for HTTP pipelining in an existing library in Python before attempting something more drastic. Specifically, I am trying to pipeline a series of PUTs (yeah, they're idempotent), like so:

PUT
PUT
PUT
get response
get response
get response

Ideally, I'd love for this to be handled for me in some kind of threadsafe way, but I'm willing to do it myself. urllib3 seems really close! Threadsafe, connection pooling, the works! I even saw some other website that offhandedly speculated that urllib3 might even do pipelining. But I hardly think that's possible, as you have to call release_connection manually after reading the body of a response.

Anyway, do you know anything about this? It's sort of surprising to me how undersupported this HTTP feature seems to be. If urllib3 doesn't support it, any wise thoughts on what I might have to do instead?

51,Support for posting big files/streaming objects,2012-02-26T22:21:29Z,,Someday,,,"Currently, it is not possible to post a 4 GB file using urllib3 since that requires reading the entire file content into a buffer before sending. (unless I'm missing something?)
It would be nice if we could pass file-like objects (objects with a read() method or something) as post variables, which will be read from on demand and perform well on huge files.
The only python script capable of this that I'm aware of is http://atlee.ca/software/poster/, which is a urllib2 opener class.

33,placeholder...,2012-01-22T13:14:31Z,2012-01-22T18:04:59Z,,,,
32,Provide a way for callers to see HTTP exceptions,2012-01-21T01:59:43Z,2014-07-03T23:12:11Z,Soon,,,"Whether a `request()` or `urlopen()` call is given `retries=0` or `retries=<positive-int>`, the exception returned on most connection and network failures is a `MaxRetryError`. This prevents client code from seeing the “real error” that killed the connection and, therefore, clients based on `urllib3` cannot, say, adjust their behavior based on whether the problem is any of the various errors at the HTTP level, or whether the problem is some specific socket error.

At least three solutions are possible, and I defer to the maintainers to decide which is the most `urllib3`-ish.

First, it could be judged a design error to have introduced `MaxRetryError` in the first place, and the final attempt's exception could be allowed to make it through to the client (some would want to throw in a `retry_count` attribute to add a bit of information about what happened, but I am not sure that that is advisable). The `except` clause near line 350 of `connectionpool.py` would then look something like:

``` python
        except (HTTPException, SocketError), e:
            # Connection broken, discard. It will be replaced next _get_conn().
            conn = None
            # If this was the last try, let the caller see the real error.
            if not retries:
                raise
```

Other adjustments to the code might accomplish the same thing — a larger refactoring could eliminate even making the final attempt inside of an `except:`, for example — but this is the simplest approach I could find for this first approach.

Second, the `MaxRetryError` could be marked up with a list of failures. This would be a bit tricky, since there are finicky problems with keeping stack traces around, but at least the exception object from each failure could be kept around — shorn of its stack trace — and delivered back with the `MaxRetryError`. This would even make it clear whether the problem was an actual network death of the HTTP protocol, or whether something like a redirect loop had kept the request going through too many attempts — and thus much more information would be available for the client to determine what had happened.

Finally, `retries=None` could be a special signal that the bare exception should be returned. This would maintain (so far as I can see) 100% compatibility with the current code base. The `ConnectionPool.urlopen()` function needs two or three lines adjusted so that the `None` value avoids offending the various `if` statements, but with minimal intrusion the change lets someone like me — whose application, alas, cares quite deeply what mode of failure an HTTP request encounters — take advantage of `urllib3` but without breaking existing code that might always expect the `MaxRetryError` exception. (Oh, and, beware — in Python 2, `None < 0` is `True`, I just discovered, so the `retries < 0` will catch a `None` value unless an extra clause is inserted!)

Of course, other approaches might also be possible that I have not thought of.

I very much like the quality of code that I am seeing in `urllib3` and, if I can only get the actual exceptions back that it encounters, these already-written connection pools are going to save me a lot of work. Thanks!

31,issue with PoolManager.request() method,2012-01-19T18:32:36Z,2012-01-20T07:06:04Z,,,,"hey, 

there's two issues i noticed today:  when i do a POST like this (using the example from your github wiki):

```
import urllib3 # (Version 1.0)

http = urllib3.PoolManager()

params = ...

r = http.request('POST', 'http://localhost:1111/my/post/uri' , params)

print r.status, r.data
```

The POST directive in the request headers does not remove the host url, e.g. it will do:

```
POST http://localhost:1111/my/post/uri
```

instead of 

```
POST /my/post/uri
```

Additionally, I noticed if i do an PoolManager.request('GET', 'http://blahblah.com', 80) after creating it tries to go into a loop retrying when I don't specify the port # in the URL. that's because it sets self.port = 80 in is_host_same() even when get_host returns ""None"".  

Let me know if I am using the API wrong, or you have problems reproducing this, or there any other issues.

30,Roll tests into the urllib3 package,2012-01-18T17:49:48Z,2012-01-22T00:05:06Z,Won't fix?,,,"If someone today installs `urllib3` with `pip` or `easy_install` into a novel environment — like the 64-bit version of an operating system that none of us have tested the library against — and receives an exception, then there is no easy way for them to quickly run the test suite to see whether the problem is that their code is faulty, or that `urllib3` itself fails its own tests in the new environment.

But if we move the `test` directory, that currently sits anonymously at the top of the repository, down into the `urllib3` directory and start shipping it as a sub-package, then users who want to double-check that `urllib3` is working would simply be able to type:

`python -m unittest discover urllib3`

Or, if they were using Python <2.7, then they could install `unittest2` and use its `unit2` command line that Michael Foord developed so that older Pythons can also enjoy the new, standard way for tests to be auto-discoverable.

It is not clear to me whether the `dummyserver` top-level package that also sits in `setup.py` stands in the way of subordinating the tests beneath the package itself. (Would the dummy server need to move down inside `urllib3/tests`?)

``` python

    raise MaxRetryError(url)
urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError: Max retries exceeded for url: http://www.google.com/
```

The reason is that each attempt to make a connection is dying with `HostChangedError` because the `is_same_host()` method in `connectionpool.py` is getting back the tuple `('http', 'www.google.com', None)` from `get_host(url)` but the slightly different tuple `('http', 'www.google.com', 80)` when it combines `self.scheme` with `self.host` and `self.port`.

Attempting the test with the URL `http://google.com:80/` also fails because a first successful request is made that redirects to `http://www.google.com/` which then dies as well with the `None != 80` problem.

Only a test with the URL `http://www.google.com:80/` succeeds, because only in that case is the explicit port number present to make `is_same_host()` succeed, and no subsequent redirect occurs to break things.

It looks like either `get_host()` needs to throw in the port `80` when building its tuple, or — if that would ruin the purity and usefulness of that function — the `is_same_host()` function needs to detect the `None` port number coming back from `get_host()` and upgrade it to 80 or 443 as appropriate.

Or: is the problem that the `self.port` that `is_same_host()` is grabbing used to have the value `None` as well, and it's the port having the value `80` so early in the process that is the problem here?

If more experienced project members could point me in the right direction here, I would be happy to contribute a patch and pull request. I could even add a test for the usage example in the documentation, so that it stays working. :) Thanks for your work on urllib3!

urllib3 apparently does not honor the timeout value when establishing a new connection.

In the code, one can see that the timeout value is being set on the socket, albeit only after the connection attempt.

conn.sock.settimeout(timeout)

I believe this partly defeats the purpose of the timeout parameter.

conn = urllib3.connection_from_url('http://host.that.times.out', timeout=1.0)

same with paypal.com and other domains... The code takes the location value from the HTTP response and issues a GET request to http://www.ynet.co.il to hostname http://ynet.co.il

9,Support for specifying a source address for connections,2011-11-16T14:14:48Z,2014-04-18T05:57:29Z,Someday,,,"Since version 2.7, httplib supports specifying a source address for HTTP(S)Connection: http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html#httplib.HTTPConnection
Would be nice if urllib3 could let me use this when creating connections.

8,Scheme and host erroneously passed to HTTPConnection request method,2011-11-14T11:08:46Z,2012-08-04T06:18:01Z,Soon,,,"I think there is a problem in the use of `httplib.HTTPConnection` method `request` when called at
[line 213 of urllib3/connectionpool.py](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L213) where you pass it the full URL, containing the scheme and host, instead of just the path (and query part), as show in [httplib usage examples](http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html#examples).

This ends up in a wrong HTTP request performed to the server. To see it, you can for instance run

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

in a shell and then, in another one, run

```
python -c 'from urllib3 import PoolManager; http = PoolManager(); http.request( ""GET"", ""http://localhost:8000/this/is/an/example"" )'
```

and compare what the access log in the first shell reports as compared to what happens if you do 

```
curl  ""http://localhost:8000/this/is/an/example""
```

I can submit a patch, but I'm not an urllib3 expert so I will probably miss some other place where the same error occurs.
