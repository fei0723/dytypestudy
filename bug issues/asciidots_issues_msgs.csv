One such example is when a dot spawned _inside_ a library's source code tries to exit (see https://github.com/aaronduino/asciidots/issues/54#issuecomment-344757596).

Instead of _only_ an error message describing the error and how to resolve it, it would be helpful if it showed the dot's spawn coordinates and it's current coordinates.

53,ASCII input,2017-11-12T19:22:27Z,2017-11-18T00:26:14Z,"discussion, enhancement",,,"Quite ironically, asciidots does not seem to support ascii input.
Or have I missed something ?

This prints ascii based on (\n-separated) list of numbers:
```
.->#?-\
  \#a$/
```
> $ echo -e ""66\n69\n78"" | asciidots example1.dots 
> B
> E
> N
> 
> Aborted!

With ascii input, this code is lost. It outputs \0 followed by \n.

> 00000002

It might be useful to have a primitive that read one char of input and store its char number (https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#ord) as dot value (exactly the opposite of `$a#`).
Thus the program could take any arbitrary input.

As a side effect of this small example, we see that it might be useful to test for EOF as well."

There is still some work to make the code more straitforward but I think it's a good start.

During my search of all places to use env, i've added more docstrings and included typing hint in them.

The proposal is to change that such that dots move in parallel (at the same time).

At the time being, this mode can be enabled with the (temporary) `-p` flag.

No test/sample programs are broken by enabling ""parallel mode"", and the only code that would be broken is code relying on interpreter quirks not specified in the readme's language/interpreter specs anyway.

What does everyone think about this?
Should ""parallel mode"" be implemented as default behaviour, or should the language be kept the same?

Either way, I think the `-p` flag should be dropped once the decision is made."

My first assumption was that the address was a index into a shared memory structure so you could have two dots backed by the same memory location with code like:

    .-*-@1-#1000-$#-& `` outputs 1000 
      |
      \-@1-$#-& `` expected output of 1000 - actual output 0

But empirically this is not how it works. My next guess was that a dot could have multiple values at different addresses.

    .-*-@1-#1000-$#-@2-#2000-$#-@1-$#-& `` expected output of 1000,2000,1000 - actual output 1000,2000,2000

But empirically this is not how it works either. It would seem that address and value are just two independent attributes on an a dot and there is no relationship between them or special meaning for either of them.

I think it would be valuable to state this explicitly in the documentation or alternatively you could rename these concepts to something less misleading such as ""value1"" and ""value2"" or ""a"" and ""b""."

5,Add debug mode to online demo,2017-08-08T19:58:02Z,2017-08-10T01:40:51Z,"enhancement, help wanted",,,"It would be great to add the debug mode features available with the offline version (as seen in [the animated gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronduino/asciidots/master/dots_debug.gif)) to the online interface.

Right now, the static site source code is hosted at [aaronduino/asciidots-static-server](https://github.com/aaronduino/asciidots-static-server) and the backend source code is hosted at [aaronduino/asciidots-server](https://github.com/aaronduino/asciidots-server).

It would probably make the most sense to add a debug mode for ANSI (that would also fix #4) and send the raw text to the client.
The client could parse the ANSI and then render the colors.

Another option would be to convert ANSI to html on the server side, but that opens up the client to injection attacks until the site uses SSL (see [backend issue #1](https://github.com/aaronduino/asciidots-server/issues/1))"
